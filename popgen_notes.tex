\section{Allele and Genotype frequencies}


\subsection{Allele frequencies}
Consider a diploid autosomal locus segregating two alleles ($1$ and $2$). Let's say that the $f_{11}$ is the frequency of $11$ homozygotes and $f_{12}$ is the frequency of $12$ heterozygotes. The frequency of allele $1$ in the population is
\begin{equation}
p = f_{11} + f_{12}/2
\end{equation}
note that this makes no assumption of Hardy-Weinberg [see below]. The frequency of the alternate allele ($2$) is then just $q=1-p$.

\subsection{Hardy-Weinberg}

Imagine a population mating at random with respect to our genotypes, i.e.
no inbreeding, no population structure, no sex differences in allele frequencies.


The frequency of allele $1$ in the population at the time of reproduction is $p$.
A $11$ genotype is made by reaching out into our population and selecting two $1$ alelle gametes to form a zygote. Therefore, the probability that
our individual is a $11$ homozygote is $p^2$. This probability is also
the expected frequency of the $11$ homozygote in the population.The
expected frequency of our three genotypes is

$f_{11}$ & $f_{12}$ & $f_{22}$ \\

$p^2$ & $2pq$ & $q^2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%\caption{\textbf{Hardy Weinberg}} \label{table:HWE}
%\end{table}
Note that we only need to assume random mating with
respect to our allele in order for these expected frequencies to hold,
as long at $p$ is the frequency of the $1$ allele in the population at
the time when gametes fuse.

\subsection{Relatedness coefficients}
We will define two alleles to be identical by descent if they are
identical due to a common ancestor in the past few generations (for the moment ignoring the
possibility of mutation). For example parent and child share exactly
one allele identical by descent at a locus (assuming that the two
parents of the child are randomly mated individuals from the population).\\

A key quantity is the probability that our pair of individuals share
0, 1, or 2 alleles identical by descent, we denote these probabilities
by $r_0$, $r_1$, and $r_2$ respectively. See Table \ref{table:IBDprobs} for
some examples. \\

One summary of relatedness, which will be of help to us, is the probability that one allele picked at
random from each of our two individuals is identical by descent.  
We call this quantity the coefficient of kinship of individual $i$ and $j$, $F_{ij}$, and can
we calculate it as
\begin{equation}
F_{ij}= 0 \times r_0 + \frac{1}{4} r_1  + \frac{1}{2} r_2  \label{eqn:coeffkinship}
\end{equation}

This quantity will appear multiple times, in both our discussion of
inbreeding and our discussion of the phenotypic resemblance between relatives.\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

identical by descent. $^{*}$ assuming this is the only relationship
the pair of individuals share (above that expected from randomly
sampling individuals from the population). } \label{table:IBDprobs}
\end{table}

\subsection{Inbreeding}
We can define an inbred individual as an individual whose parents are
more closely related to each other than two random individuals drawn
from some reference population.  \\

When two related individuals produce an offspring, that individual can
receive two alleles that are identical by descent, i.e. they
can be homozygous by descent (sometimes termed autozygous), due to the
fact that they have two copies of an allele through different paths
through the pedigree.  This increased likelihood of being homozygous
relative to an outbred individual is the most obvious effect of
inbreeding, and the one that will be of most interest to us as it
underlies a lot of our ideas about inbreeding depression and
population structure.\\


As the offspring receives a random allele from each parent ($i$ and $j$) the
probability that those two alleles are identical by descent is our
kinship coefficient $F_{ij}$ of the two parents (i.e. the quantity we
defined in eqn. \ref{eqn:coeffkinship}). This follows from the fact that
our child's genotype is made by sampling an allele at random from each
of our parents.\\


The only way the offspring can be heterozygous ($A_1 A_2$) is if their two alleles at a
locus, are not IBD (otherwise they'd necessarily be homozygous). Therefore, the probability that they are
heterozygous is
\begin{equation}
(1-F) 2p q.
\end{equation}
Our offspring can homozygous for the $A_1$ allele two different ways,
they can have two non-IBD alleles which happen to be the $A_1$ allele ,
or their two alleles can be IBD, such that they inherited the $A_1$ by
two different routes from the same ancestor. Thus the probability they
are homozygous is
\begin{equation}
(1-F) p^2 + F p
\end{equation}
Therefore, our three genotype probabilities can be written as given in
Table \ref{table:GeneralizedHWE}, generalizing our Hardy Weinberg
proportions.\\

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|ccc|}
\hline
$f_{11}$ & $f_{12}$ & $f_{22}$ \\
\hline
$(1-F) p^2 + F p$ & $(1-F) 2pq$ & $(1-F) q^2 + F q$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\textbf{Generalized Hardy Weinberg}} \label{table:GeneralizedHWE}
\end{table}

Note that the generalized Hardy Weinberg proportions completely
specify our genotype probabilities, as there are two parameters ($p$ and $F$)
and two degrees of freedom (as our frequencies have to sum to one).
Therefore, any combination of genotype frequencies at a biallelic site
can be specified by a combination of $p$ and $F$.\\


\subsection{Calculating inbreeding coefficients from data}
If the observed heterozygosity is $f_{12}$ then an estimate of
our inbreeding coefficient is
\begin{equation}
\hat{F} = 1-\frac{f_{12}}{2pq} = \frac{2pq - f_{12}}{2pq} \label{eqn:Fhat}
\end{equation}
where $p$ is the frequency of the allele in our reference
population. This can be rewritten in terms of the observed heterozygosity ($H_O=f_{12}$)
and expected heterozygosity ($H_E=2pq$)
\begin{equation}
\hat{F} = \frac{H_E-H_O}{H_E}. \label{eqn:FhatHO}
\end{equation}
If we have multiple loci we can replace $H_O$ and $H_E$ by their means
over loci $\bar{H}_O$ and $\bar{H}_E$. \\

\subsection{Summarizing Population structure}
Our estimated inbreeding coefficient gives us a nice way to take a
first look at population structure. \\

We defined inbreeding as having parents that are
more closely related to each other than two random individuals drawn
from some reference population. So the question naturally arises,
which reference population should we use? While I might not look inbred in
comparison to allele frequencies in the UK (where I'm from), my
parents certainly aren't too random individuals drawn from across the
world-wide population. If we calculated $F$ using allele frequencies
within the UK, the inbreeding coefficient for me $F$ would (hopefully)
be close to zero, but would likely be larger if we used world-wide
frequencies. That's because there's a somewhat lower level of
heterozygosity within the UK than in the human population across the world as a whole.  \\

Wright (1943, 1951) developed a set of `F-statistics' (fixation statistics) that formalized these ideas
about inbreeding. Wright defined $F_{XY}$ as:
the correlation between random gametes, drawn from the same $X$,
relative to $Y$. We'll return to why $F$ statistics are statements
about correlations between alleles in just a moment. One commonly use $F_{IS}$ for the inbreeding
coefficient between an individual ($I$) and the subpopulation
($S$). Consider a single locus, where in a sub-population ($S$) a fraction $H_I=f_{12}$ of our individuals
are heterozygotes. In this sub-population ($S$) the frequency of
allele $1$ is $p_S$ and the expected heterozygosity is $H_S$. We will write $F_{IS}$ as
\begin{equation}
F_{IS} =1-\frac{H_I}{H_S}= 1-\frac{f_{12}}{2p_Sq_S} \label{eqn:FIS}
\end{equation}
the direct analog of eqn. \ref{eqn:Fhat}, which compares the observed
heterozygosity to that expected under random mating within the sub-population. We could also compare our
heterozygosity in individuals ($H_I$) to that expected in the total
population ($H_T$). If the frequency of our allele in our total
population is $p_T$, then we can write $F_{IT}$ as
\begin{equation}
F_{IT} =1-\frac{H_I}{H_T}= 1-\frac{f_{12}}{2p_Tq_T} \label{eqn:FIT}
\end{equation}
which compares heterozygosity in individuals to that expected in the
total population. As a simple extension of this we could imagine
comparing the expected heterozygosity in the subpopulation ($H_S$) to
that expected our total population ($H_T$), via $F_{ST}$
\begin{equation}
F_{ST} = 1-\frac{H_S}{H_T}=1-\frac{2p_Sq_S}{2p_Tq_T} \label{eqn:FST}
\end{equation}
If our total population contains our sub-population then, as we'll see
below due to the Wahlund effect (to be added)
 $2p_Sq_S \leq
2p_Tq_T$ and so $F_{IS} \leq F_{IT}$ and $F_{ST} \geq 0$. We can
relate our three $F$ statistics together as
\begin{equation}
(1-\hat{F_{IT}}) =\frac{H_I}{H_S} \frac{H_S}{H_T}=(1-F_{IS})(1-F_{ST}) \label{eqn:F_relationships}
\end{equation}
i.e. the reduction in heterozygosity in our individuals compared to that expected
in the total population can be decomposed to the reduction in
heterozygosity of individuals compared to the sub-population, and the reduction in
heterozygosity from the total population to that in the sub-population.\\

If we want a summary of
population structure across multiple sub-populations we can average $H_I$
and/or $H_S$ across populations, and use a $p_T$ calculated by
averaging $p_S$ across sub-populations. Furthermore, if we have multiple sites we can replace $H_I$, $H_S$, and $H_T$ with
their averages across loci (as above). \\

Lets now return to Wright's definition of the $F_{XY}$ statistic as correlation between random gametes, drawn from the same $X$,
relative to $Y$. With out loss of generality lets think about $X$ as
individuals and $S$ as the sub-population.
Rewriting $F_{ST}$ in terms of our homozygote frequencies observed in
individuals ($f_{11}$ and $f_{22}$) we find
\begin{equation}
F_{IS} = \frac{2p_Sq_S - f_{12}}{2p_Sq_S} = \frac{f_{11}+f_{22} -
p_S^2 - q_S^2}{2p_Sq_S} \label{eqn:Fascorr}
\end{equation}
using the fact that $p^2+2pq+q^2=1$. The form of this
(eqn. \ref{eqn:Fascorr}) is the covariance between pairs of alleles
found in an individual, divided by the
expected variance under binomial sampling. Thus $F$ statistics can be
understood as the correlation between alleles drawn from a population
(or an individual) above that expected by chance (i.e. drawing alleles
sampled at random from some broader population). \\

We can also see $F$ statistics as proportions of variance explained by
substructure. To see this lets think about $F_{ST}$ averaged over $K$
subpopulations, whose frequencies are $p_1,~\cdots,~p_K$. The
frequency in the total population is $p_T=\bar{p} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^K p_i$.
Then we can
write
\begin{equation}
F_{ST} = \frac{2 \bar{p}\bar{q} - \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^K 2p_iq_i }{2
\bar{p}\bar{q}} = \frac{ \left(\frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^K p_i^2 +
\frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^K q_i^2 \right) -  \bar{p}^2-\bar{q}^2 }{2
\bar{p}\bar{q}} = \frac{Var(p_i)}{Var(\bar{p})} \label{eqn:F_as_propvar}
\end{equation}
i.e. $F_{ST}$ is the proportion of the variance explained by the
subpopulation labels.

\section{The phenotypic resemblance between relatives}
We can use our understanding the sharing of alleles between relatives
to understand the phenotypic resemblance between relatives in
quantitative phenotypes. We can then use this to understand the
evolutionary change in quantitative phenotypes in response to selection. \\

Let's imagine that the genetic component of the variation in our trait
is controlled by $L$ autosomal loci that act in an additive manner. The frequency of allele $1$ at locus $l$ is $p_l$, with each copy of
allele $1$ at this locus increasing your trait value by $a_l$.
The phenotype of an individual, let's call her $i$, is $Y_i$.
Her genotype at SNP $l$, is
$G_{i,l}$. Here $G_{i,l}=0,~1,$ or $2$  represents the number of copies of allele $1$ she
has at this SNP. Her expected phenotype, given her genotype, is then
\begin{equation}
X_{A,i} = \E (X_i | G_{i,1},\cdots,G_{i,L}) =  \sum_{l=1}^L G_{i,l} a_{l}
\end{equation}
Now in reality the genetic phenotype is a function of the
expression of those alleles in a particular environment. Therefore, we
can think of this expected phenotype as being an average across a set
of environments that occur in the population. \\

When we measure our individual's phenotype we see
\begin{equation}
X_i =   X_{A,i} + X_{E,i} \label{pheno_geno_environ}
\end{equation}
where $X_E$ is the deviation from the mean phenotype due to the
environment. This $X_E$ included the systematic effects of the environment
our individual finds herself in and all of the noise during
development, growth, and the various random insults that life throws
at our individual. If a reasonable number of loci contribute to
variation in our trait then we can approximate the distribution of
$X_{A,i}$ by a normal distribution due to the central limit theorem (see R exercise). Thus if we can
approximate the distribution of the effect of environmental variation
on our trait ($X_{E,i}$) also by a normal distribution, which is
reasonable as there are many small environmental effects, then the
distribution of phenotypes within the population ($X_i$) will be
normally distributed (see Figure \ref{fig:QT1}).\\

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figs/QT1.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{The convergence of the phenotypic distribution to a normal distribution.} \label{fig:QT1}
\end{figure}


Note that as this is an additive model we can decompose eqn. \ref{pheno_geno_environ} into the
effects of the two alleles at each locus, in particular we can rewrite
it as
\begin{equation}
X_i = X_{iM}+X_{iP} +X_{iE}
\end{equation}
where $X_{iM}$ and $X_{iP}$ are the contribution to the phenotype of
the allele that our individual received from her mother (maternal
alleles) and father (paternal alleles) respectively. This will come in
handy in just a moment when we start thinking about the phenotype covariance of relatives.\\


\subsubsection{Additive genetic variance and heritability}
As we are talking about an additive genetic model we'll talk about the
additive genetic variance ($V_A$), the variance due to the additive
effects of segregating genetic variation. This is a subset of the total genetic
variance if we allow for non-additive effects. \\

The variance of our phenotype across individuals ($V$) can write this as
\begin{equation}
V = Var(X_A) + Var(X_E) = V_A+V_E
\end{equation}
in doing writing this we are assuming that there is no covariance between $X_{G,i}$
and $X_{E,i}$ i.e. there is no covariance between genotype and
environment. \\

Our additive genetic variance can be written as
\begin{equation}
V_A = \sum_{l=1}^L Var(G_{i,l} a_{l})
\end{equation}
where $Var(G_{i,l} a_{l})$ is the contribution to the additive
variance among individuals of the $l$ locus. Assuming random mating we
can write our additive genetic variance as
\begin{equation}
V_A = \sum_{l=1}^L a_{l}^2 2 p_l(1-p_l)
\end{equation}
where the $ 2 p_l(1-p_l)$ term follows the binomial sampling of two
alleles per individual at each locus. \\

\paragraph{The narrow sense heritability}
We would like a way to think about what proportion of the variation
in our phenotype across individuals is due to genetic differences as
opposed to environmental differences. Such a quantity will be key in
helping us think about the evolution of phenotypes. For example, if
variation in our phenotype had no genetic basis then no matter how
much selection changes the mean phenotype within a generation
the trait will not change over generations. \\

We'll call the proportion of the variance that is genetic the
heritability, and denote it by $h^2$. We can then write this as
\begin{equation}
h^2 = \frac{Var(X_A)}{V} = \frac{V_A}{V}
\end{equation}
remember that we thinking about a trait where all of the alleles act
in a perfectly additive manner. In this case our heritability $h^2$ is
referred to as the narrow sense heritability, the proportion of the
variance explained by the additive effect of our loci.
When we allow dominance
and epistasis into our model we'll also have to define the broad sense
heritability (the total proportion of the phenotypic variance
attributable to genetic variation).\\

The narrow sense heritability of a trait is a useful quantity, indeed
we'll see shortly that it is exactly what we need to understand the
evolutionary response to selection on a quantitative phenotype. We can
calculate the narrow sense heritability by using the resemblance between
relatives. For example, if our phenotype was totally environmental we
should not expect relatives to resemble each other any more than random
individuals drawn from the population. Now the obvious caveat here is
that relatives also share an environment, so may resemble each other
due to shared environmental effects. \\

\subsubsection{The covariance between relatives}
So we'll go ahead and calculate the covariance in phenotype between two individuals
($1$ and $2$) who have a phenotype $X_1$ and $X_2$ respectively.
\begin{equation}
Cov(X_1,X_2) =
Cov\left((X_{1M}+X_{1P}+X_{1E}),((X_{2M}+X_{2P}+X_{2E}) \right)
\end{equation}
We can expand this out in terms of the covariance between the various
components in these sums.\\

To make our task easier we (and most analyses) will assume two things
\begin{enumerate}
\item that we can ignore the covariance of the environments
between individuals (i.e. $Cov(X_{1E},X_{2E})=0$)
\item that we can ignore the covariance
between the environment variation experience by an individual and the
genetic variation in another individual (i.e. $Cov(X_{1E},(X_{2M}+X_{2P}))=0$).
\end{enumerate}

The failure of these assumptions
to hold can severely undermine our estimates of heritability, but we'll
return to that later. Moving forward with these assumptions, we can
write our phenotypic covariance between our pair of individuals as
\begin{equation}
Cov(X_1,X_2) =
Cov((X_{1M},X_{2M})+Cov(X_{1M},X_{2P})+Cov(X_{1P},X_{2M})
+Cov(X_{1P},X_{2P}) \label{cov_rels_1}
\end{equation}
This is saying that under our simple additive model we can see the
covariance in phenotypes between individuals as the covariance between
the allelic effects in our individuals. We can use our results about
the sharing of alleles between relatives to obtain these terms.
But before we write down the general case lets quickly work through some
examples. \\


\paragraph{The covariance between Identical Twins}
Lets first consider the case of a pair of identical twins from two
unrelated parents. Our pair of twins share their maternal and paternal
allele identical by descent ($X_{1M}=X_{2M}$ and $X_{1P}=X_{2P}$). As their maternal and
paternal alleles are not correlated draws from the population,
i.e. have no probability of being $IBD$ as we've said the parents are unrelated, the
covariance between their effects on the phenotype is zero  
(i.e. $Cov(X_{1P},X_{2M})=Cov(X_{1M},X_{2P})=0$). In that case
eqn. \ref{cov_rels_1} is
\begin{equation}
Cov(X_1,X_2) = Cov((X_{1M},X_{2M})+Cov(X_{1P},X_{2P}) = 2Var(X_{1M})
= V_A
\end{equation}
Now in general identical twins are not going to be super helpful for
us in estimating $h^2$ as under models with non-additive effects
identical twins have higher covariance than we'd expect as they
resemble each other also because of the dominance effects as they
don't just share alleles they share their entire genotype.\\

\paragraph{The covariance in phenotype between mother and child}.
If the mother and father are unrelated individuals (i.e. are two
random draws from the population) then the mother and a child share
one allele IBD at each locus (i.e. $r_1=1$ and $r_0=r_2=0$). Half the
time our mother transmits her paternal allele to the child, in which
case $X_{P1}=X_{M1}$ and so $Cov(X_{P1},X_{M2})=Var(X_{P1})$ and all
the other covariances in eqn. \ref{cov_rels_1} zero, and half
the time she transmits her maternal allele to the child
$Cov(X_{M1},X_{M2})=Var(X_{P1})$ and all the other terms zero. By this
argument $Cov(X_1,X_2) = \half Var(X_{M1}) + \half Var(X_{P1}) = \half
V_A$. \\

\paragraph{The covariance between general pairs of relatives under an
additive model}
The two examples make clear that to understand the covariance between
phenotypes of relatives we simply need to think about the alleles they
share IBD. Consider a pair of relatives ($x$ and $y$) with a probability $r_0$,
$r_1$, and $r_2$ of sharing zero, one, or two alleles IBD
respectively. When they share zero alleles
$Cov((X_{1M}+X_{1P}),(X_{2M}+X_{2P}))=0$, when they share one allele
$Cov((X_{1M}+X_{1P}),(X_{2M}+X_{2P}))=\half
Var(X_{1M})=\frac{1}{4}V_A$, and when they share two alleles $Cov((X_{1M}+X_{1P}),(X_{2M}+X_{2P}))=
Var(X_{1M})=\half V_A$. Therefore, the general covariance between two
relatives is
\begin{equation}
Cov(X_1,X_2) = r_0 \times 0 + r_1 \frac{1}{4}V_A + r_2 \half V_A =
F_{x,y} V_A
\end{equation}\\

So under a simple additive model of the genetic basis of a phenotype
to measure the narrow sense heritability we need to measure the
covariance between a set of pairs of relatives (assuming that we can remove the effect of
shared environmental noise). From the covariance between relatives we
can calculate $V_A$, we can then divide this by the total phenotypic
variance to get $h^2$. \\
%One way potentially to get somewhat around the
%shared environmental effect is to use paternal half-sibs as they share a

Another way that we can estimate the narrow sense heritability is
through the regression of child's phenotype on the parental mid-point
phenotype. The parental mid-point phenotype is simple the average of
the mum and dad's phenotype. Denoting the child's phenotype by $X_{kid}$ and mid-point
phenotype by $X_{mid}$ so that if we take the regression $X_{kid} \sim X_{mid}$ this
regression has slope $\beta = Cov(X_{kid},X_{mid})/Var(X_{mid})$.
The covariance of $Cov(X_{kid},X_{mid})=\half
V_A$, and $Var(X_{mid}) = \half V$ as by taking the average of the
parents we have halved the variance, such that the slope of the
regression is
\begin{equation}
\beta= \frac{Cov(X_{kid},X_{mid})}{Var(X_{mid})} = \frac{V_A}{V} = h^2
\end{equation}
i.e. the regression of the child's phenotype on the parental midpoint
phenotype is an estimate of the narrow sense heritability. This is a
common way to estimate heritability, although it doesn't bypass the
need to control for environmental correlations between relatives. \\

Our regression allows us to attempt to predict the phenotype of the
child given the child; how well we can do this depends on the
slope. If the slope close to zero then the parental phenotypes hold no
information about the phenotype of the child, while if the slope is
close to one then the parental mid-point is a good guess at the child's
phenotype.\\
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figs/QT2.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Regression of parental mid-point phenotype on child's
  phenotype.}
\end{figure}

More formally the expected phenotype of the child given the parental
phenotypes is
\begin{equation}
\E(X_{kid} | X_{mum},X_{dad}) = \mu +
\beta(X_{mid} - \mu) =\mu + h^2(X_{mid} - \mu)  \label{predict_kid}
\end{equation}
this follows from the definition of linear regression. So to find the
child's predicted phenotype we simply take the mean phenotype and add
on the difference between our parental mid-point multiplied by our
narrow sense heritability. \\

\subsubsection{The response to selection}
Evolution by natural selection requires:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Variation in a phenotype
\item That survival is non-random with respect to this phenotypic
variation.
\item That this variation is heritable.
\end{enumerate}
Points 1 and 2 encapsulate our idea of Natural Selection, but evolution by natural
selection will only occur if the 3rd condition is met. It is the
heritable nature of variation that couples change within a generation
due to natural selection, to change across generations (evolutionary
change). \\

Lets start by thinking about the change within a generation due
to directional selection, where selection acts to change the mean
phenotype within a generation. For example, a decrease in mean height within a
generation, due to taller organisms having a lower chance of surviving
to reproduction than shorter organisms. Specifically, we'll denote our mean phenotype at
reproduction by $\mu_S$, i.e. after selection has acted, and our mean
phenotype before selection acts by $\mu_{BS}$. This second quantity may be hard to
measure, as obviously selection acts throughout the life-cycle, so it
might be easier to think of this as the mean phenotype if selection
hadn't acted. So the mean phenotype changes within a generation is $\mu_{S} - \mu_{BS}= S$.  \\

We are interested in predicting the distribution of phenotypes in next
generation, in particular we are interested in the mean phenotype in
the next generation to understand how directional selection has
contributed to evolutionary change. We'll denote the mean phenotype in
offspring, i.e. the mean phenotype in the next generation before selection acts,
as $\mu_{NG}$. The change across generations we'll call the response
to selection $R$ and put this equal to $\mu_{NG}- \mu_{BS}$. \\

The mean phenotype in the next generation is
\begin{equation}
\mu_{NG} = \E \left( \E(X_{kid} | X_{mum},X_{dad}) \right)
\end{equation}
where the outer expectation is over the randomly mating of individuals
who survive to reproduce. We can use eqn. \ref{predict_kid} to obtain
an expression for this
\begin{equation}
\mu_{NG} = \mu_{BS} +
\beta ( \E(X_{mid}) - \mu_{BS})
\end{equation}
so to obtain $\mu_{NG}$ we need to compute $\E(X_{mid})$ the expected
mid-point phenotype of pairs of individuals who survive to
reproduce. Well this is just the expected phenotype in the individuals
who survived to reproduce ($\mu_{S}$), so
\begin{equation}
\mu_{NG} = \mu_{BS} +
h^2 (\mu_S - \mu_{BS})
\end{equation}
So we can write our response to selection as
\begin{equation}
R = \mu_{NG} -\mu_{BS}  =
h^2 (\mu_S - \mu_{BS}) = h^2 S \label{breeders_eqn}
\end{equation}
So our response to selection is proportional to our selection
differential, and the constant of proportionality is the narrow sense
heritability. This equation is sometimes termed the Breeders
equation. It is a statement that the evolutionary change across
generations ($R$) is proportional to the change caused by directional selection
within a generation, and the strength of this relationship is
determined by the narrow sense heritability. \\

Using the fact that $h^2=V_A/V$ we can rewrite this in a different form as
\begin{equation}
R= V_A \frac{S}{V}
\end{equation}
i.e. our response to selection is the additive genetic variance of our
trait ($V_A$) multiplied by the change within a generation as a
fraction of the total phenotypic variance ($S/V$).\\

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figs/QT3.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A change in mean phenotype within a generation occurs because of the
differential fitness of our organisms. To think more carefully about this change within a
generation lets think about a simple fitness model where our phenotype affects the
viability of our organisms (i.e. the probability they survive to
reproduce). The probability that an individual has a phenotype $X$
before selection is $p(X)$, so that the mean phenotype before
selection is
\begin{equation}
\mu_{BS} = \E[X] =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x p(x) dx
\end{equation}
The probability that an organism with a phenotype $X$ survives to
reproduce is $w(X)$, and we'll think about this as the fitness of
our organism. The probability distribution of phenotypes in those who
do reproduce is
\begin{equation}
\P(X | \textrm{survive}) =  \frac{p(x) w(x)}{
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) w(x) dx}.
\end{equation}
where the denominator is a normalization constant which ensures that
our phenotypic distribution integrates to one. The denominator also
has the interpretation of being the mean fitness of the population,
which we'll call $\wbar$, i.e.  
\begin{equation}
\wbar =  
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) w(x) dx.
\end{equation}


Therefore, we can write the mean phenotype in those who survive to
reproduce as
\begin{equation}
\mu_S = \frac{1}{\wbar}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x p(x) w(x) dx
\end{equation}

If we mean center our population, i.e. set the phenotype before
selection to zero, then
\begin{equation}
S= \frac{1}{\wbar}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x p(x) w(x) dx
\end{equation}
if $\mu_S=0$.  Inspecting this more closely we can see that $S$ has
the form of a covariance between our phenotype $X$ and our fitness
$w(X)$ ($Cov(X,w(X))$). Thus our change in mean phenotype is directly a measure of the
covariance of our phenotype and our fitness. Rewriting our breeder's
equation using this observation we see
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{V_A}{V}  Cov(X,w(X))
\end{equation}
we see that the response to selection is due to the fact that our
fitness (viability) of our organisms/parents covaries with our phenotype, and
that our child's phenotype is correlated with the parent phenotype.

\section{Correlations between loci, linkage disequilibrium, and recombination.}

%</source-file>

Up to now we've been interested in correlations between alleles at the
same locus, e.g. correlations within individuals (inbreeding) or between
individuals (relatedness). We turn our attention now to think about
correlations between alleles at different loci. To start to understand
correlations between loci we need to first understand a bit about recombination.\\


\paragraph{Recombination}  Lets
consider an individual heterozygous for a $AB$ and $ab$
haplotype. If no recombination occurs between our two loci in this
individual, then these two haplotypes will be transmitted intact to
the next generation. While if a recombination (or more generally an
odd number of recombinations) occurs between our two loci on the
haplotype transmitted to the child then $\tfrac{1}{2}$ the time the
child receives a $Ab$ haplotype and $\tfrac{1}{2}$ the time the child
receives a $aB$ haplotype. So recombination is breaking up the
association between loci. We'll define the recombination fraction ($r$) to be
the probability of an odd number of recombinations between our loci.
In practice we'll often be interested in relatively short regions
where recombination is relatively rare, and so we might think that
$r=r_{BP}L \ll 1$, where $r_{BP}$ is the average recombination rate
per base pair (typically $\sim 10^{-8}$) and L is the number of base
pairs separating our two loci.\\



\paragraph{Linkage disequilibrium}
The (horrible) phrase linkage
disequilibrium (LD) refers to the statistical non-independence
(i.e. a correlation)  of
alleles at different loci. Our two loci, which segregate alleles $A/a$ and $B/b$, have a allele
frequencies of $p_A$ and $p_B$ respectively. The frequency of the two locus haplotype is $p_{AB}$,
and likewise for our other three combinations. If our loci were
statistically independent then $p_{AB} = p_Ap_B$, otherwise $p_{AB} \neq p_Ap_B$
We can define a covariance between the $A$ and $B$ alleles at our two loci as
\begin{equation}
D_{AB} = p_{AB} - p_Ap_B
\end{equation}
and likewise for our other combinations at our two loci
($D_{Ab},~D_{aB},~D_{ab}$). These $D$ statistics are all closely
related to each other as $D_{AB} = - D_{Ab}$ and so on. Thus we only
need to specify one $D_{AB}$ to know them all, so we'll drop the
subscript and just refer to $D$. Also a handy result is that we can rewrite our haplotype
frequency $p_{AB}$ as
\begin{equation}
p_{AB} = p_Ap_B+D. \label{eqn:ABviaD}
\end{equation}
If $D=0$ we'll say the two loci are in linkage equilibrium, while if
$D>0$ or $D<0$ we'll say that the loci are in linkage
disequilibrium (we'll perhaps want to test whether $D$ is
statistically different from $0$ before making this choice). You should be careful to keep the concepts of linkage
and linkage disequilibrium separate in your mind. Genetic linkage refers to the
linkage of multiple loci due to the fact that they
are transmitted through meiosis together (most often because the
loci are on the same chromosome). Linkage disequilibrium merely refers
to the correlation between the alleles at different loci, this may in
part be due to the genetic linkage of these loci but does not
necessarily imply this (e.g. genetically unlinked loci can be in LD
due to population structure). \\

Another common statistic for summarizing LD is $r^2$ which we write as
\begin{equation}
r^2 = \frac{D^2}{p_A(1-p_A) p_B(1-p_B) }
\end{equation}
as $D$ is a covariance, and $p_A(1-p_A) $ is the variance of an allele
drawn at random from locus $A$, $r^2$ is the squared correlation
coefficient.    \\


{\bf Question.} You genotype 2 bi-allelic loci (A \& B) segregating in two mouse subspecies (1 \& 2) which mate randomly among themselves, but have not historically interbreed since they speciated. On the basis of previous work you estimate that the two loci are separated by a recombination fraction of 0.1. The frequencies of haplotypes in each population are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|cccc|}
\hline
Pop    & $p_{AB}$    & $p_{Ab}$ &    $p_{aB}$ &    $p_{ab}$\\
\hline
1 &    .02    & .18 &     .08 &    .72\\
2&    .72 &    .18 &    .08 &    .02\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

{\bf A)} How much LD is there within populations, i.e. estimate D?\\

{\bf B)} If we mixed the two populations together in equal proportions what value would D take before any mating has had the chance to occur? \\



\paragraph{The decay of LD due to recombination}
We've now think about what happens to LD over the generations if we
only allow recombination to occur in a very large population (i.e. no
genetic drift, i.e. the frequencies of our loci follow their expectations). To do so consider the frequency of our $AB$ haplotype in the next generation
$p_{AB}^{\prime}$. We lose a fraction $r$ of our $AB$ haplotypes to
recombination ripping our alleles apart but gain a fraction $rp_A p_B$ per generation from other
haplotypes recombining together to form $AB$ haplotypes. Thus in the
next generation
\begin{equation}
p_{AB}^{\prime} = (1-r)p_{AB} + rp_Ap_B
\end{equation}
this last term here is $r(p_{AB}+p_{Ab})(p_{AB}+p_{aB})$, which
multiplying this out is the
probability of recombination in the different diploid genotypes that
could generate a $p_{AB}$ haplotype. \\

We can then write the change in the frequency of the $p_{AB}$
haplotype as
\begin{equation}
\Delta p_{AB} = p_{AB}^{\prime} -p_{AB} = -r p_{AB} + rp_Ap_B = - r D
\end{equation}
so recombination will cause a decrease in the frequency of $p_{AB}$ if
there is an excess of $AB$ haplotypes within the population ($D>0$), and an
increase if there is a deficit of $AB$ haplotypes within the
population ($D<0$). Our LD in the next generation is $D^{\prime} =
p_{AB}^{\prime}$, so we can rewrite the above eqn. in terms of the
$D^{\prime} $
\begin{equation}
D^{\prime}= (1-r) D
\end{equation}
so if the level of LD in generation $0$ is $D_0$ the level $t$
generations later ($D_t$) is
\begin{equation}
D_t=  (1-r)^t D_0
\end{equation}
so recombination is acting to decrease LD, and it does so
geometrically at a rate given by $(1-r)$. If $r \ll 1$ then we can
approximate this by an exponential and say that   
\begin{equation}
D_t \approx  D_0 e^{-rt}
\end{equation}\\



{\bf Q C)} You find a hybrid population between the two mouse subspecies
described in the question above, which appears to be comprised of equal proportions of ancestry from the two subspecies.  You estimate LD between the two markers to be 0.0723. Assuming that this hybrid population is large and was formed by a single mixture event, can you estimate how long ago this population formed? \\

%\subsection{Testing for departures from HWE.}
%Note the form of $\hat{F}$ \eqref{eqn:FhatHO} is the same as the $X^2$
%statistic, and so we can test for a deviation from hardy-weinberg  $X^2$


%\subsection{Population structure}
%The question naturally arises at this point: what reference population
%(i.e. what allele frequency) do we use to calculate $\hat{F}$? If we are %calculating the inbreeding coefficient
%of an English person do we use the frequencies of the town of that
%person, of England, of the United Kingdom, or of the World?

\section{One locus models of selection}

\subsection{fitness}


We will define the absolute fitness of a genotype to be the
expected number of offspring of an individual of that
genotype. Natural selection occurs when there are differences between
our genotypes in their fitness. This difference could occur at any
point during the life cycle. \\

\subsection{Haploid selection model}

The numbers individuals carrying allele 1 and allele 2 in generation
$t$ are $P_t$ and $Q_t$
respectively. The current frequency of allele 1 is $p=P_t/(P_t+Q_t)$.\\

In the next generation the number of of type 1 and 2 individual is
$P_{t+1} = w_1 P_t$ and $Q_{t+1}=w_2 Q_t$
The mean fitness of our population is  $w_1 p_t+w_2 q_t$, i.e. the
fitness of the two alleles weighted by their frequencies within the population.\\

The frequency of allele $1$ in the next generation
\begin{equation}
p_{t+1} = \frac{ w_1 P_t}{ w_1 P_t+ w_2 Q_t} =  \frac{ w_1 p_t}{ \wbar}
\end{equation}
The change in frequency form one generation to the next is
\begin{equation}
\Delta p = p_{t+1} - p_t= \frac{ w_1 p_t}{ \wbar} - p_t =
\frac{pq(w_1-w_2)}{\wbar} \label{eq:deltap_haploid}
\end{equation}
As this fraction represents a ratio of fitnesses, we only need to
specify our fitness up to an arbitrary constant. I.e. we can use
relative fitnesses in this equation \eqref{eq:deltap_haploid} as we are free to use $w_1/w_1=1$
and $w_2/w_1$ in place of $w_1$ and $w_2$ because as long as we use them
consistently in the numerator and denominator of
\eqref{eq:deltap_haploid} the arbitrary constant $1/w_1$ will cancel
out. Intuitively this makes sense, you can produce a huge number of children but you are out of luck as far as natural selection is concerned
if others in the population are having more. What matters is your fitness relative to others in the
population. By convention we do this by dividing through all our absolute fitnesses by
that of the most fit individual, so that the fittest type in our population has
a relative fitness of one.\\

Assuming that $w_1>w_2$ our relative fitnesses are $1$ and $w_2/w_1<1$
respectively, we will sometimes replace $w_2/w_1=1-s$. Our $s$ here is
a selection coefficient the difference in relative fitnesses between
our haploid alleles.\\


Assuming that the fitnesses of our two alleles are constant over time,
the number of the 2 allelic types $\tau$ generations later is
$P_{t+\tau} = (w_1)^{\tau} P_t$ and $Q_{t+\tau}=  (w_2)^{\tau} Q_t$
and so
\begin{equation}
p_{t+\tau} = \frac{ (w_1)^{\tau} P_t}{ (w_1)^{\tau} P_t+
(w_2)^{\tau} Q_t} = \frac{p_t}{p_t+q_t(1-s)^{\tau}}   \label{eq:haploid_tau_gen}
\end{equation}
as $(w_2/w_1) = 1-s$ then if $s \ll 1$
\begin{equation}
p_{t+\tau} \approx
\frac{p_t}{p_t+q_te^{-s\tau}} \label{eq:haploid_logistic growth}
\end{equation}
This form is logistic growth, and follows from the fact that we are
looking at the relative frequencies of two populations (allele $1$ and
$2$) that are growing (or declining) exponentially.\\

Rearranging \eqref{eq:haploid_tau_gen} we can work out the time for our frequency to
change from a frequency $p_0$ to $p^{\prime}$ as follows
\begin{equation}
\frac{p^{\prime}}{q^{\prime}} = \frac{p_0}{q_0} \left( \frac{w_1}{w_2}\right)^t
\end{equation}
therefore, using the fact that $w_1/w_2=1/(1-s)$
\begin{equation}
-t \log(1-s) = \log \left( \frac{p^{\prime}}{q^{\prime}}
\frac{q_0}{p_0}  \right)
\end{equation}
assuming that $s \ll 1$ we can replace the left hand side by $ts$.\\


One particular case of interest is the time it takes to go through
introduction to near fixation in a population of size $N$ (e.g. $p=1/N$ to
$p^{\prime} = 1-1/N$) this takes time  $t \approx
\log(N)/s$ (assuming $s \ll 1$).\\

\paragraph{Haploid model with fluctuating selection}
We can now consider the case where our fitnesses depend on time, and
say that $w_{1,t}$ and $w_{2,t}$ are the fitnesses of the two types in
generation $t$. The frequency of allele 1 in generation $t+1$ is
\begin{equation}
p_{t+1} = \frac{w_{1,t}p_{t}}{\wbar_t}
\end{equation}
The ratio of the frequency of allele 1 to allele 2 in generation $t+1$
is
\begin{equation}
\frac{p_{t+1}}{q_{t+1}} = \frac{w_{1,t}}{w_{2,t}}  \frac{p_{t}}{q_{t}}
\end{equation}
Therefore if we think of our alleles starting in generation $0$ at
frequencies $p_0$ and $q_0$, then $t+1$ generations later
\begin{equation}
\frac{p_{t+1}}{q_{t+1}} = \left(\prod_{i=0}^{t} \frac{w_{1,i}}{w_{2,i}}  \right) \frac{p_{t}}{q_{t}}
\end{equation}
So the question of which allele is increasing or decreasing in frequency comes down
to whether $\left(\prod_{i=0}^{t} \frac{w_{1,i}}{w_{2,i}}  \right)$ is
$>1$ or $<1$. As it is a little hard to think about this ratio, we can
instead take the $t^{th}$ root of this and instead consider
\begin{equation}
\sqrt[t]{\left(\prod_{i=0}^{t} \frac{w_{1,i}}{w_{2,i}}  \right)} = \frac{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{1,i}}}{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{2,i}}}
\end{equation}
$\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{1,i}}$ is the geometric mean fitness of allele
1 over our $t$ generations. Therefore our allele 1 will only increase
in frequency if it has a higher geometric mean fitness than allele 2
(at least in our simple deterministic model). \\


\subsection{Diploid model}
We'll move now to a diploid model of a single locus segregating $2$ alleles.
We'll assume that our difference in fitness between our three
genotypes comes from differences in viability, i.e. differential
survival of individuals of our three genotypes to reproduction.  
The fitnesses of three genotypes will be denoted by $w_{11}$, $w_{12}$, and $w_{22}$.
On our individuals mate at random, so the number of our three
genotypes at birth are:
\begin{equation}
Np_t^2, ~~~  N2p_tq_t, ~~~ Nq_t^2
\end{equation}
The mean fitness of the population is then
\begin{equation}
w_{11} p_t^2+w_{12} 2p_tq_t  +  w_{22} q_t^2
\end{equation}\\

We can now ask how many of each of our three genotypes survive to reproduce.
Well an individual of genotype $11$ has a probability of $w_{11}$ of
surviving to reproduce, and similarly for other genotypes. So that
the number of our three genotypes who survive to reproduce is
\begin{equation}
Nw_{11} p_t^2, ~~~ Nw_{12} 2p_tq_t , ~~~ N w_{22} q_t^2
\end{equation}
it then follows that the total number of individuals who survive to
reproduce is
\begin{equation}
N \left(w_{11} p_t^2+w_{12} 2p_tq_t  +  w_{22} q_t^2 \right)
\end{equation}
this is simply our mean fitness of the population multiplied by the
population size (i.e. $N \wbar$).\\

The frequency of our $11$ genotype individuals at reproduction
is simply the number of $11$ genotype individuals at reproduction ($Nw_{11} p_t^2$)
divided by the total number of individuals who survive to reproduce
($N \wbar$),
and likewise for our other two genotypes.
Therefore, the frequency of individuals with the three different genotypes at reproduction is
\begin{equation}
\frac{Nw_{11} p_t^2}{N\wbar}, ~~~ \frac{Nw_{12} 2p_tq_t}{N\wbar} , ~~~ \frac{N w_{22} q_t^2}{N\wbar}
\end{equation}
see Table \ref{dip_fitness_table}.\\

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
& 11 & 12& 22\\
\hline
Num. at birth & $Np_t^2$ & $N2p_tq_t$ & $Nq_t^2$\\
Fitnesses & $w_{11}$ & $w_{12}$& $w_{22}$\\
Num. at repro. & $Nw_{11} p_t^2$ & $Nw_{12} 2p_tq_t$& $N w_{22} q_t^2$\\
freq. at repro. & $\frac{Nw_{11} p_t^2}{N \wbar}$ & $\frac{Nw_{12} 2p_tq_t}{N
\wbar}$& $\frac{N w_{22} q_t^2}{N\wbar}$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{} \label{dip_fitness_table}
\end{table}

As there is no difference in the fecundity of our three genotypes, the
allele frequency in the offspring in the next generation is simply the
allele frequency in the individuals. The frequency in the next generation is
\begin{equation}
p_{t+1} = \frac{w_{11} p_t^2 + w_{12} p_tq_t}{\wbar} \label{pgen_dip}
\end{equation}

note that again the absolute value of our fitnesses is irrelevant to
the frequency of the allele. Therefore, we can just as easily replace
our absolute fitnesses with our relative fitnesses.\\

The change in frequency from generation $t$ to $t+1$ is
\begin{equation}
\Delta p = p_{t+1} -p_{t}= \frac{w_{11} p_t + w_{12} p_tq_t}{\wbar} - p_t. \label{deltap_dip1}
\end{equation}
To simplify this equation
we will first define two variables $\wbar_1$ and $\wbar_2$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
\wbar_1 & = w_{11} p_t + w_{12} q_t, \\
\wbar_2 & =  w_{12} p_t+ w_{22} q_t.
\end{eqnarray}
Our variables $\wbar_1$ and $\wbar_2$ are called the marginal fitnesses of allele 1
and allele 2 respectively. They are called this as $\wbar_1$ is the
average fitness of an allele 1, i.e. the fitness of the 1 allele in a
homozygote weighted by the probability it is in a homozygote ($p_t$)
plus the fitness of the 1 allele in a
heterozygote weighted by the probability it is in a heterozygote ($q_t$).
We can then rewrite \eqref{deltap_dip1} usng $\wbar_1$ and $\wbar_2$ as
\begin{equation}
\Delta p = \frac{p_tq_t (\wbar_1-\wbar_2)}{\wbar}.  \label{deltap_dip2}
\end{equation}
The sign of $\Delta p$, i.e. whether allele 1 increases of decreases
in frequency, depends only on the sign of $(\wbar_1-\wbar_2)$.
The frequency of allele 1 will keep increasing over the generations so
long as its marginal fitness is higher than that of allele 2,
i.e. $\wbar_1 > \wbar_2$, while if $\wbar_1 < \wbar_2$ then the
frequency  of allele 1 will decrease. (We will return to the
special case where $\wbar_1 = \wbar_2$ shortly).\\


We can also rewrite \eqref{deltap_dip1} as
\begin{equation}
\Delta p_t = \frac{p_tq_t}{\wbar}\frac{d \wbar}{dp}.  \label{deltap_dip3}
\end{equation}
the demonstration of this we leave to the reader. This form shows that
$\Delta p$ in increase if $\frac{d \wbar}{dp}>1$, i.e. increasing the
frequency of $1$ increases the mean fitness, while the frequency of
the allele with decrease if this increases the mean fitness of the
population ($\frac{d \wbar}{dp}>1$). Thus although selection acts on
individuals, under this simple model selection is acting to increase
the mean fitness of the population, and it does so at a rate given by
the variance in allele frequencies within the population ($pq$).\\

{\bf Question)} Show that  \eqref{deltap_dip3} and \eqref{deltap_dip1} are equivalent.\\

%%Selection coeffs in diploid model
\subsubsection{Diploid directional selection}
Our diploid model is going to reveal a number of insights. We'll
start with a simple model of directional selection, i.e.
one our our alleles is always has higher marginal fitness than the other. Let's assign
allele 1 to be the fitter allele, so that $w_{11} \geq w_{12} \geq w_{22}$.
As we are interested in changes in allele frequencies we are only
interested in relative fitnesses. To parameterize our reduction in
relative fitness in terms of a selection coefficient, similar to the
one we met in the haploid selection section, as follows\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
& 11 & 12 & 22 \\
abs. fitness & $w_{11}$ & $ \leq w_{12} \leq$ & $w_{22}$ \\
rel. fitness & $w_{11}/w_{11}$ & $w_{12}/w_{11}$ & $w_{22}/w_{11}$ \\
rel. fitness  & $1$ & $1-sh$ & $1-s$ \\
\end{tabular}\\
\end{center}
here our selection coefficient $s$ is the difference in relative
fitness between our two homozygotes, while we will call $h$ our
dominance coefficient. Our dominance coefficient allows us to move
from the situation where allele $1$ has a fully dominant effect on fitness (and $2$ is
totally recessive) when $h=0$, such that the heterozygote exactly
resembles the $1$ homozygotes, to the converse case where the allele $1$ is fully
recessive ($h=1$, and allele $2$ is dominant).

%, of the $12$ and
%$22$ genotypes we will use selection coefficients $s_{12} \leq 0$ and
%$s_{22} \leq s_{12}$

We can then rewrite \eqref{deltap_dip2} as
\begin{equation}
\Delta p = \frac{p_tq_t (p_ths + qs(1-h)}{\wbar}.  \label{deltap_direct}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\wbar = 1-2p_tq_t sh-q_t^2s
\end{equation}\\

One special case is when $s_{12}=s_{22}/2$
\begin{equation}
\Delta p = \frac{p_tq_t s/2}{\wbar}.  \label{deltap_add}
\end{equation}
for values of $s \ll 1$ then the denominator is close to $1$ and this
is of exactly the same form as our haploid model and so if $s$ is
constant our trajectory follows a logistic growth curve of the form \eqref{eq:haploid_logistic growth}.
Thus we can show that it takes
\begin{equation}
\approx 2 log(2N)/s
\end{equation}
generations for our selected
allele to transit from its entry into the population ($p_0 =1/(2N)$)
to close to fixation ($p^{\prime} =1-1/(2N)$).\\

\subsubsection{heterozygote advantage}
What about the case where our heterozygotes are fitter than either
of the homozygotes. We parameterize the relative fitnesses as follows\\
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
& 11 & 12 & 22 \\
abs. fitness & $w_{11}$ & $<w_{12}>$ & $w_{22}$ \\
rel. fitness & $w_{11}/w_{12}$ & $w_{12}/w_{12}$ & $w_{22}/w_{12}$ \\
rel. fitness  & $1-s_1$ & $1$ & $1-s_2$ \\
\end{tabular}\\
so $s_1$ and $s_2$ are the differences between the relative fitnesses
of the two homozygotes and the heterozygote. Note that to obtain
relative fitnesses we've divided
through our fitnesses by the heterozygote fitness. We could use the
same parameterization as in our directional selection model, but this
slight reparameterization makes the math prettier.\\

In this case, when our allele $1$ is rare it is often found in a
heterozygous state and so it increases in frequency. However, when
allele $1$ is common it is often found in the homozygote state, while
the allele $2$ is often found in the heterozygote state, and so it is
now $2$ that increases in frequency at the expense of allele
$1$. Thus, at least in our deterministic model, neither allele can
reach fixation and our allele will be maintained as a balanced
polymorphism in the population at an equilibrium frequency.\\

We can solve for this equilibrium frequency by setting $\Delta p=0$ in
\eqref{deltap_dip2},
i.e. $p_tq_t (\wbar_1-\wbar_2)=0$ which permits three stable equilibrium, two
uninteresting ($p=0$ or $q=0$) and one polymorphic where
$\wbar_1-\wbar_2$ at equilibrium frequency $p_e$.
In this case the marginal fitnesses of our two alleles are exactly
equal ($\wbar_1-\wbar_2$), substituting in our selection coefficients
this implies
\begin{equation}
p_e = \frac{s_2}{s_1+s_2}
\end{equation}
This is also that the mean fitness of the population is maximised.\\

\paragraph{Under-dominance.} Another case that is of potential interest is the case of fitness
underdominance where the heterozygote is less fit than either of the
homozygotes. \\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
& 11 & 12 & 22 \\
abs. fitness & $w_{11}$ & $>w_{12}<$ & $w_{22}$ \\
rel. fitness  & $1+s_1$ & $1$ & $1+s_2$ \\
\end{tabular}\\
\end{center}
this case also permits three equilibria $p=0$, $p=1$, and a
polymorphic equilibrium $p=p_U$ however
now only the first two equilibria are stable, while the polymorphic
equilibrium is now unstable. If $p<p_U$ then $\Delta p $ is negative
and the allele $1$ proceeds to loss, while if $p>p_U$ then the allele
$1$ will proceed to fixation.   \\

While such alleles might not spread within populations (if $p_U \gg
0$ and selection is reasonably strong), they are of interest in the study of speciation and hybrid
zones. That's because our allele $1$ and $2$ may have arisen in a
stepwise fashion, i.e. not by a single mutation, in separate
subpopulations and our heterozygote disadvantage will now play a
potential role in species maintenance. \\

\paragraph{Diploid Fluctuating fitness}
We would like to think about the case where the diploid absolute fitnesses
are time-dependent with our three genotypes having fitnesses
$w_{11,t}$, $w_{12,t}$, and $w_{22,t}$ in generation $t$. However,
this case is much less tractable than the haploid case, as segregation
makes it tricky to keep track of the genotype frequencies.  
We can make some progress and gain some intuition by thinking about
how the frequency of allele 1 changes when it is rare. (This argument
is originally due to Haldane and J. )\\

When allele 1 is rare, i.e. $p \ll 1$ our frequency in the next
generation \eqref{pgen_dip} can be approximated as
\begin{equation}
p_{t+1} \approx \frac{w_{12}p_t}{\wbar}
\end{equation}
by ignoring the $p_{t}^2$ term and assuming $q_t \approx 1$ in the numerator.
Following a similar argument to approximate $q_{t+1}$, we can write
\begin{equation}
\frac{p_{t+1}}{q_{t+1}} = \frac{w_{12,t}}{w_{22,t}}  \frac{p_{t}}{q_{t}}
\end{equation}
Then starting from out from $p_0$ and $q_0$ in generation $0$, $t+1$
generations later
\begin{equation}
\frac{p_{t+1}}{q_{t+1}} = \left( \prod_{i=1}^t \frac{w_{12,i}}{w_{22,i}}  \right) \frac{p_{0}}{q_{0}}.
\end{equation}
From this we can see, following our haploid argument from above, that
the frequency of our allele 1 will increase when rare only if
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{12,i}}}{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{22,i}}}>1 \label{geometric_1wins}
\end{equation}
i.e. if the $12$ heterozygote has higher geometric mean fitness than the $22$ homozygote.\\

The question now is, will allele 1 approach fixation in the population,
or are there cases where our allele can become a balanced
polymorphism? To investigate that we can simply repeat our analysis
for $q \ll 1$, and see that in that case
\begin{equation}
\frac{p_{t+1}}{q_{t+1}} = \left( \prod_{i=1}^t \frac{w_{11,i}}{w_{12,i}}  \right) \frac{p_{0}}{q_{0}}.
\end{equation}
i.e. now for our allele 1 to carry on increasing in frequency and to
approach fixation in our population our $11$ genotype has to be
out-completing our $12$ heterozygotes. For our allele 1 to approach
fixation we need the geometric mean of $w_{11,i}$ to be greater than the
geometric mean fitness of heterozygotes ($w_{12,i}$)
While if heterozygotes have higher geometric mean fitness than
our $1$ homozygotes than the $2$ allele will increase in frequency when it is rare.
Therefore, a balanced polymorphism can result when the heterozygote
has higher geometric fitness than either of the homozygotes.\\

%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{11,i}}}{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{22,i}}}>1
%\end{equation}
%implying that our $11$ homozygotes have to have higher geometric mean
%fitness than our heterozygotes.
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{11,i}}}{\sqrt[t]{\prod_{i=0}^{t}w_{22,i}}}<1  \label{geometric_2wins}
%\end{equation}
%(satisfying both \eqref{geometric_1wins} and
%\eqref{geometric_2wins}).

Intriguingly we can have a balanced polymorphism even if the
heterozygote is never the fittest genotype in any generation. To see
this consider the simple example, where there are two environments
alternate generation to generations\\
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
& 11 & 12 & 22 \\
Environ. A abs. fitness & $w_{11,A}$ & $>w_{12,A}>$ & $w_{22,A}$ \\
Environ. B abs. fitness & $w_{11,B}$ & $<w_{12,B}<$ & $w_{22,B}$ \\
Geometric mean fitness & $w_{11,B}$ & $<w_{12,B}>$ & $w_{22}$ \\
\end{tabular}\\
so that the polymorphism will remain balanced in the population,
despite the fact that the heterozygote is never the fitest genotype.


\subsection{Mutation Selection Balance}
%</source-file>
Mutation is constantly introducing new alleles into the
population. Therefore, variation can be maintained within our
population even if it is deleterious through a balance between
mutation introducing alleles and selection acting to purge these alleles.
To see this we'll return to our directional selection model, where the
allele $1$ is advantageous i.e.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
& 11 & 12 & 22 \\
abs. fitness & $w_{11}$ & $ \geq w_{12} \geq$ & $w_{22}$ \\
rel. fitness  & $1$ & $1-sh$ & $1-s$ \\
\end{tabular}\\
\end{center}
and for the moment we'll consider the case where the allele $2$ is not
completely recessive $h>0$. We'll be interested in the case where our allele $2$ is rare within
the population i.e. $q \ll 1$, which means that the change in
frequency of allele $2$, due to selection ($\Delta_S q$) can be written as
\begin{equation}
\Delta_S q = \frac{pq(\wbar_2 - \wbar_1)}{\wbar}  \approx 2 hs q
\end{equation}
which can be found by assuming that $q^2 \approx 0$, $p \approx 1$,
and that $\wbar \approx w_1$. So selection is acting to reduce the
frequency of our allele $2$ and does so geometrically across the
generations. \\

We'll now consider the change in frequency induced by mutation. Lets
assume that our mutation rate from allele $1$ to allele $2$ is $\mu$
per generation (mutation also could occur from allele $2$ to $1$
however this is a small effect as long as the reverse mutation rate
isn't too large). The frequency of $q$ in the next generation is
\begin{equation}
q^{\prime} =  \mu(1-q)
\end{equation}
assuming that $\mu \ll 1$ and that $q \ll 1$ then the change in the
frequency of allele $2$ due to mutation ($\Delta_M q$) is
\begin{equation}
\Delta_M q = \mu
\end{equation}
i.e. mutation is, when allele $2$ is rare, is acting to linearly
increase the frequency of the deleterious allele.\\

We'll obtain a balance between mutation acting to increase the
frequency of our allele and selection acting to decrease the frequency
of our allele when these two forces are at equilibrium i.e.
\begin{equation}
\Delta_M q + \Delta_S q = 0
\end{equation}
this equilibrium occurs when
\begin{equation}
q_e = \frac{\mu}{hs} \label{eqn:mut_sel_bal}
\end{equation}
i.e. our allele frequency is balanced at our mutation rate divided by
the reduction in relative fitness in the heterozygote ($hs$).\\

Note that in this calculation the fitness of the $22$ homozygote
hasn't entered into this, as our allele is rare and so rarely in a
homozygous state. Therefore, if our allele has any deleterious effect
in a heterozygous state it is this effect that determines the
frequency it is maintained at within the population. Note that in
writing our total allele frequency change as $\Delta_M q + \Delta_S q
$ we have implicitly assumed that we can ignore terms of order $\mu
\times s$ as they are small (this allows us to separate the change in
allele frequencies from mutation and selection).\\


So what effect do such mutations have on the population? Consider the
effect a single site segregating at $q_E = \mu/(hs)$) has on mean relative fitness
\begin{equation}
\wbar = 1- 2p_Eq_Ehs-q_E^2s \approx 1-2u
\end{equation}
somewhat remarkably the drop in mean fitness due to a site segregating
at mutation selection balance is (unless the site is totally
recessive) independent of the selection coefficient against the
heterozygote and depends only the mutation rate.

While this reduction is very small at an individual site (e.g. the
mutation rate of a gene is likely $<1^{-5}$) there are many loci
segregating at mutation selection balance. This can be a big source of
genetic load and a major cause of variation in fitness related traits among individuals.

As an aside, if an allele was truly recessive (although few likely are) $h=0$ and
so \eqref{eqn:mut_sel_bal} is not valid, however, we can proceed
through a similar line of reasoning, to that outlined above, to show
that for truly recessive alleles $q_e = \sqrt{\mu/s}$.


\subsubsection{Inbreeding depression}
All else being equal, mutations that have a smaller effect in the
heterozygote can segregate at higher frequency under mutation
selection balance. As a consequence of this, alleles that have
strongly deleterious effects in the homozygous state can segregate at
low frequencies in the population, as long as they do not have a
strong effect in heterozygotes. Thus outbred populations may have many
alleles with recessive deleterious effects segregating within them.

On consequence of this is that inbred individuals from usually outbred
populations may have dramatically lower fitnesses than outbred
individuals as a consequence of being homozygous at many loci for
alleles with recessive deleterious effects. Indeed this seems to be
the case a common observation (dating back to systematic surveys by
Darwin) in that in typically outbred populations the mean fitness of individuals
decreases with the inbreeding coefficient, i.e. inbreeding depression
is a common observation.

\paragraph{Purging the inbreeding load}
That said, populations who regularly inbreed over sustained time
periods are expected to partially purge this load of deleterious
alleles. This is because these populations have exposed many of these alleles
in a homozygous state and so selection can more readily remove these alleles
from the population.

\newpage
\subsection{Migration-Selection Balance}
Another reason for the persistence of deleterious alleles in a
population is that there is a constant influx of maladaptive alleles
from other populations where these alleles are locally adapted.
This seems unlikely to be as broad an explanation for the
persistence of deleterious alleles genome-wide as mutation-selection
balance. However, a brief discussion of such alleles is worthwhile as
it helps to inform our ideas about local adaptation.\\

As a first pass at this lets consider a haploid two allele model with
two different populations, where the relative fitnesses of our alleles
are as follows
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cc}
allele & $1$ & $2$ \\
\hline
population 1 & 1 & 1-s \\
population 2 & 1-s & 1 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
As a simple model of migration lets suppose within a population a
fraction of $m$ individuals are migrants from the other population,
and $1-m$ individuals are from the same deme.\\

To quickly sketch a solution to this well set up a situation analogous
to our mutation-selection balance model. to do this lets assume that selection is strong compared to migration ($s \gg m$) then allele
$1$ will be almost fixed in population $1$ and allele $2$ will be
almost fixed in population $2$. If that is the case,
migration changes the frequency of allele $2$ in population $1$ ($q_1$) by
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{Mig.} q_1 \approx m
\end{equation}
while as noted above $\Delta_{S} q_1= -sq_1$, so that migration and
selection are at an equilibrium when $\Delta_{S} q_1+
\Delta_{Mig.}q_1$, i.e. an equilibrium frequency of allele $2$ in
population $1$ of
\begin{equation}
q_{e,1} = \frac{m}{s}
\end{equation}
so that migration is playing to role of mutation and so
migration-selection balance (at least under strong selection) is
analogous to mutation selection balance.\\

\subsubsection{Some theory of the spatial distribution of allele
frequencies under deterministic models of selection}
Imagine a continuous haploid population spread out along a line. 
individual dispersals a random distance $\Delta x$ from its birthplace to the
location where it reproduces, where $\Delta x$ is drawn from the probability
density $g(~)$. To make life simple we will assume that $g(\Delta x)$
is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation
$\sigma$, i.e. migration is unbiased an individuals migrate an average
distance of $\sigma$. \\

Our frequency of allele $2$ at time $t$ in the population at spatial
location $x$ is $q(x,t)$. Assuming that only dispersal occurs, how
does our allele frequency change in the next generation. Our allele
frequency in the next generation at location $x$ reflects
the migration from different locations in the proceeding
generation. Our population at location $x$ receives a contribution
$g(\Delta x)q(x+\Delta x,t)$ of allele $2$ from the population at location $x+\Delta x$,
such that the frequency of our allele at $x$ in the next generation is
\begin{equation}
q(x,t+1) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(\Delta x)q(x+\Delta x,t) d \Delta x.
\end{equation}
To obtain
$q(x+\Delta x,t)$ lets take a taylor series expansion of $p(x,t)$
\begin{equation}
q(x+\Delta x,t) = q(x,t) + \Delta x \frac{dq(x,t)}{dx}+ \tfrac{1}{2}(\Delta x)^2 \frac{d^2q(x,t)}{dx^2}+\cdots
\end{equation}
then
\begin{equation}
q(x,t+1) = q(x,t) +\left( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Delta x g(\Delta x) 
  d \Delta x \right) \frac{dq(x,t)}{dx} + \tfrac{1}{2}\left( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(\Delta x)^2 g(\Delta x) 
  d \Delta x \right)  \frac{d^2q(x,t)}{dx^2}+\cdots
\end{equation} 
$g(~)$ has a mean of zero so $ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Delta x g(\Delta x) 
  d \Delta x =0$ and has variance $\sigma^2$ so $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(\Delta x)^2 g(\Delta x) 
  d \Delta x = \sigma^2$ and all higher terms are zero (as all high
  moments of the normal are zero). Looking at the change in frequency $\Delta
  q(x,t) = q(x,t+1)-q(x,t+1)$ then 
\begin{equation}
\Delta q(x,t) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{d^2q(x,t)}{dx^2}
\end{equation} 
this is a diffusion equation, so that migration is acting to smooth
out allele frequency differences with a diffusion constant
of $\tfrac{\sigma^2}{2}$. This is exactly analogous to the equation
describing how a gas diffuses out to equal density, as both particles
in a gas and our individuals of type $2$ are performing brownian
motion (blurring our eyes and seeing time as continuous). \\


We will now introduce fitness differences into our model and set the
relative fitnesses of allele $1$ and $2$ at location $x $ to be $1$ and
$1+s\gamma(x)$. To make progress in this model we'll have to assume that selection
isn't too strong i.e. $s \gamma(x) \ll 1$ for all $x$. The the change in
frequency of allele $2$ obtained within a generation due to selection is
\begin{equation}
q^{\prime}(x,t) - q(x,t) \approx s\gamma(x) q(x,t) \big( 1 - q(x,t) \big)
\end{equation}
i.e. logistic growth of our favoured allele at location $x$. 
Putting our selection and migration terms together we find 
\begin{equation}
q(x,t+1) - q(x,t) = s\gamma(x) q(x,t) \big( 1 - q(x,t)
\big)+\frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{d^2q(x,t)}{dx^2} \label{eqn:fisherKPP}
\end{equation}
in derving this we have essentially assumed that migration acted upon our original
frequencies before selection and in doing so have ignored terms of the
order of $\sigma s$. 


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figs/equilib_cline.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{An equilibrium cline in allele frequency. Our individuals
  dispersal an average distance of $\sigma=1$km per generation, and our
allele $2$ has a relative fitness of $1+s$ and $1-s$ on either side of
the environmental change at $x=0$.} \label{fig:cline}
\end{figure}


To make progress lets consider a simple model of location adaptation
where the environment abruptly changes. Specifically we assume that
$\gamma(x)= -1$
for $x<0$ and $\gamma(x)= 1$ for $x \geq 0$, i.e. our allele $2$ has a
selective advantage at locations to the left of zero, while this
allele is at a disadvantage to the right of zero. In this case we can
get an equilibrium distribution of our two alleles were to the left
of $zero$ our allele $2$ is at higher frequency, while to the right of
zero allele $1$ predominates. As we cross from the left to the right
side of our range the frequency of our allele $2$ decreases in a
smooth cline.\\



%Under such a model the change in frequency of allele $2$ at location $x$ at time $t$,
%$q(x,t)$, over time follows the differential equation
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{dq(x,t)}{dt} = s\gamma(x) q(x,t) \left( 1 - q(x,t) \right) + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{d^2q(x,t)}{dx^2}
%\end{equation}
%the first term on the right-hand side is the logistic growth of our
%favoured allele at location $x$, while the second term on the
%right-hand side is the diffusion of allele frequencies due to
%dispersal (i.e. dispersal is acting to spread out the effect of
%allele frequency change across populations). See below for how we
%derive this \gc{to be added}.\\

Our equilibrium spatial distribution of allele frequencies can be found by
setting the LHS of eqn. \eqref{eqn:fisherKPP} to zero to arrive at
\begin{equation}
s\gamma(x) q(x) \left( 1 - q(x) \right) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{d^2q(x)}{dx^2}
\end{equation}
We then could solve this differential equation with appropriate boundary
conditions ($q(-\infty)=1$ and $q(\infty) = 0$) to arrive at the
appropriate functional form to our cline. While we won't go into the
solution of this equation here, we can note that by dividing our
distance $x$ by $\ell=\sigma/\sqrt{s}$ we can remove the effect of our
parameters from the above equation. This compound parameter $\ell$ is the characteristic
length of our cline, and it is this parameter which determines over
what geographic scale we change from allele $2$ predominating to
allele $1$ predominating as we move across our environmental shift. \\

The width of our cline, i.e. over what distance do we make this shift
from allele $2$ predominating to allele $1$,
can be defined in a number of different ways. One simple way to define
the cline width, which is easy to define but perhaps hard to measure accurately, is the slope (i.e. the
tangent) of $q(x)$ at $x=0$. Under this definition the cline width is approximately $0.6
\sigma/\sqrt{s}$.\\

\newpage
\section{Stochasticity and Genetic Drift in allele frequencies}
\subsection{Stochastic loss of strongly selected alleles}
% Fisher (1922, 1930) and Haldane (1927)
Even strongly selected alleles can be lost from the population when
they are sufficiently rare. This is because the number of offspring
left by individuals to the next generation is fundamentally
stochastic. A selection coefficient of s=$1\%$ is a strong
selection coefficient, which can drive an allele through the
population in a few hundred generations once the allele is
established. However, if individuals have on average a small number of
offspring per generation the first individual to carry our allele who
has on average $1\%$ more children could easily have zero offspring, leading to the loss
of our allele before it ever get a chance to spread.\\

To take a first stab at this problem lets think of a very large
haploid population, and in order for this population to stay constant in size
we'll assume that individuals without the selected mutation have on average one
offspring per generation. While individuals with our selected allele
have on average $1+s$ offspring per generation. We'll assume that the
distribution of offspring number of an individual is Poisson
distributed with this mean, i.e. the probability that an individual
with the selected allele has $i$ children is
\begin{equation}
P_i= \frac{(1+s)^i e^{-(1+s)}}{i!}
\end{equation}

Consider starting from a single individual with the selected allele, and ask
about the probability of eventual loss of our selected allele starting
from this single copy ($p_L$). To derive this we'll make use of a
simple argument (derived from branching processes). Our selected
allele will be eventually lost from the population if every individual
with the allele fails to leave descendents.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In our first generation
with probability $P_0$ our individual leaves no copies of itself to
the next generation, in which case our allele is lost.
\item Alternatively
it could leave one copy of itself to the next generation (with
probability $P_1$), in which
case with probability $p_L$ this copy eventually goes extinct.
\item It could leave two copies of itself to the next generation (with
probability $P_2$), in which
case with probability $p_L^2$ both of these copies eventually goes extinct.
\item More generally it could leave could leave $k$ copies ($k>0$) of itself to the next generation (with
probability $P_k$), in which case with probability $p_L^k$  all of these copies eventually go extinct.
\end{enumerate}
summing over this probabilities we see that
\begin{eqnarray}
p_L &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} P_k p_L^{k}  \nonumber \\
&=  \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(1+s)^ke^{-(1+s)}}{k!} p_L^{k} \nonumber
\\
&= e^{-(1+s)} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\left(p_L(1+s) \right)^k}{k!}  \right)
\end{eqnarray}
well the term in the brackets is itself an exponential expansion, so
we can rewrite this as
\begin{equation}
p_L = e^{(1+s)(p_L-1)} \label{prob_loss}
\end{equation}
solving this would give us our probability of loss for any selection
coefficient. Lets
rewrite this in terms of the the probability of escaping loss $p_F = 1-p_L$.  We can
rewrite eqn \eqref{prob_loss} as
\begin{equation}
1-p_F = e^{-p_F(1+s)}
\end{equation}
to gain an approximation to this lets consider a small selection
coefficient $s \ll 1$ such that $p_F \ll 1$ and then expanded out the
exponential on the right hand side (ignoring terms of higher
order than $s^2$ and $p_F^2$) then
\begin{equation}
1-p_F \approx 1-p_F(1+s)+p_F^2(1+s)^2/2
\end{equation}
solving this we find that
\begin{equation}
p_F = 2s.
\end{equation}
Thus even an allele with a $1\%$ selection coefficient has a $98\%$
probability of being lost when it is first introduced into the
population by mutation. \\

%%consider reparameterizing 1+(1-hs)s
We can also adapt this result to a diploid setting.
Assuming that heterozygotes for the $1$ allele have $1+(1-h)s$ children, the
probability of allele $1$ is not lost, starting from a single copy in
the population, is
\begin{equation}
p_F = 2 (1-h)s \label{eqn:diploid_escape}
\end{equation}
for $h>0$.\\


\subsection{The interaction between genetic drift and weak selection.}
For strongly selected alleles, once the allele has escaped initial
loss at low frequencies, their path will be determined deterministically by their
selection coefficients. However, if selection is weak the
stochasticity of reproduction can play a role in the trajectory an
allele takes even when it is common in the population.\\

To see this lets think of our simple Wright-Fisher model (see R
exercise). Each generation we allow a deterministic change in our
allele frequency, and then binomially sample two alleles for each of
our offspring to construct our next generation.\\


%%%%%Include this discussion of sampling back in our HWE section??
%%%%%Next time

So the expected change in our allele frequency within a generation is given just by our
deterministic formula. To make things easy on our self lets assume an
additive model, i.e. $h=1/2$, and that $s \ll 1$ so that $\wbar
\approx 1$. This gives us
\begin{equation}
\E(\Delta p ) = \frac{s}{2} p(1-p) \label{eqn:WF_mean}
\end{equation}
our variance in our allele frequency change is given by
\begin{equation}
Var(p^{\prime} - p) = Var(p^{\prime}) = \frac{p^{\prime}(1-p^{\prime})}{2N}
\end{equation}
this variance in our allele frequency follows from the fact that we
are binomially sampling $2N$ new alleles in the next
generation from a frequency $p^{\prime}$. Denoting our count of allele $1$ by $i$ our
\begin{equation}
Var(p^{\prime} - p) = Var(\frac{i}{2N} - p) =  Var(\frac{i}{2N} ) =\frac{Var(i)}{(2N)^2}
\end{equation}
and from binomial sampling $Var(i) = 2N p^{\prime}(1-p^{\prime})$ and
so we arrive at our answer. Assuming that $s \ll 1$, $p^{\prime}
\approx p$, then in practice we can use
\begin{equation}
Var(\Delta p)  =Var(p^{\prime} - p) \approx \frac{p(1-p)}{2N}. \label{eqn:WF_var}
\end{equation}
To get our first look at the relative effects of selection vs drift we
can simply look at when our change in allele frequency caused
selection within a generate is reasonably faithfully passed across
the generations. In particular if our expected change in frequency is much
great than the variance around this change, genetic drift will play
little role in the fate of our selected allele (once the allele is not
too rare within the population). When does selected
dominant genetic drift? This will happen if $\E(\Delta p) \gg Var(\Delta p)$ when $Ns \gg 1$. Conversely any
hope of our selected allele following its deterministic path will be quickly undone if our change in allele frequencies due to selection is
much less than the variance induced by drift. So if $Ns \ll 1$ then
drift will dominate the fate of our allele. \\


To make further progress on understanding the fate of alleles with
selection coefficients of the order $1/N$ requires more careful
modeling. However, we can obtain the probability that under our diploid model, with an additive selection coefficient $s$, the
probability of allele $1$ fixing within the population starting
from a frequency $p$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\pi(p) = \frac{1-e^{-2Ns p }}{1-e^{-2Ns}} \label{eqn:prob_fixed}
\end{equation}
the proof of this is sketched out below (see Section \ref{Section:fixation_weakly_sel}). A new allele will arrive in the population at frequency $p=1/(2N)$,
then its probability of reaching fixation is
\begin{equation}
\pi \left(\frac{1}{2N} \right) = \frac{1-e^{-s }}{1-e^{-2Ns}}
\end{equation}
if $s \ll1$ but $Ns \gg 1$ then $\pi(\frac{1}{2N}) \approx s$, which
nicely gives
us back our result that we obtained above
(eqn. \eqref{eqn:diploid_escape}).\\

In the case where $Ns$ close to $1$ then
\begin{equation}
\pi(\frac{1}{2N}) \approx \frac{s}{1-e^{-2Ns}} \label{eqn:escape_from_intro}
\end{equation}
this is greater than $s$, increasingly so for smaller $N$.
Why is this? Well in small populations selected alleles spend a
somewhat shorter time segregating (especially at low frequencies), and so are
slightly less susceptible to genetic drift. \\

\subsubsection{The fixation of slightly deleterious alleles.}
We can also use eqn. \eqref{eqn:escape_from_intro} to understand how
likely it is that deleterious alleles accidently reach fixation by
genetic drift, assuming a diploid model with additive selection (with
a selection coefficient of $-s$ against our allele $2$).  
If $N s \gg 1$ then our deleterious allele (allele $2$) can not possibly reach
fixation. However, if $Ns$ is not large then
\begin{equation}
\pi(\frac{1}{2N}) = \frac{s}{e^{2Ns}-1} \label{eqn:fix_deleterious}
\end{equation}
for our deleterious allele. So deleterious alleles can fix within
populations (albeit at a low rate) if $Ns$ is not too large.\\

\subsubsection{A Sketch Proof of the probability of fixation of
weakly selected alleles} \label{Section:fixation_weakly_sel}
%Kolmogorov backward eqn. 1931
%Kimura, M. 1962 On the Probability of Fixation of Mutant Genes in a
%Population. for abitrary dominance in diffusion.

We'll let $P(\Delta p)$ be the probability that our allele frequency
shifts by $\Delta p$ in the next generation. Using this we can write our probability $\pi(p)$ in terms of the probability of
achieving fixation averaged over the frequency in the next generation
\begin{equation}
\pi(p)  = \int \pi(p+\Delta p) P(\Delta p) d(\Delta p) \label{eqn:prob_fix_diff_step1}
\end{equation}
This is very similar to the technique that we used deriving our
probability of escaping loss in a very large population above. \\

So we need an expression for $\pi(p+\Delta p)$. To obtain this we'll
do a Taylor series expansion of $\pi(p)$ assuming that $\Delta p $ is small
\begin{equation}
\pi(p+\Delta p) \approx \pi(p) + \Delta p \frac{d\pi(p)}{dp} + (\Delta p)^2
\frac{d^2\pi(p)}{dp^2} (p)
\end{equation}
ignoring higher order terms.\\

Taking the expectation over $\Delta p $ on both sides, as in
eqn. \ref{eqn:prob_fix_diff_step1}, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\pi(p) = \pi(p) + \E(\Delta p) \frac{d\pi (p)}{dp} + \E((\Delta p)^2)
\frac{d^2\pi(p)}{dp^2}
\end{equation}

Well $\E(\Delta p) = \frac{s}{2}p(1-p)$ and $Var(\Delta p)= \E(\Delta
p)^2)-\E^2(\Delta p)$, so if $s \ll 1$ then $\E^2(\Delta p) \approx
0$, and $\E(\Delta p)^2 = \frac{p(1-p)}{2N}$. This leaves us with
\begin{equation}
0= \frac{s}{2}p(1-p)\frac{d\pi (p) }{dp} + \frac{p(1-p)}{2N}
\frac{d^2\pi (p) }{dp^2}
\end{equation}
and we can specify the boundary conditions to be $\pi(1)=1$ and $\pi(0)=0$. 
Solving this differential equation is somewhat involved process but in
doing so we find that
\begin{equation}
\pi(p) = \frac{1-e^{-2Ns p }}{1-e^{-2Ns}}
\end{equation}


\section{Genetic drift and Neutral alleles}

A neutral polymorphism occurs when the segregating alleles at a
polymorphic site have no discernable effect on
the fitness of the organism (i.e. if they have any effect on fitness
at all drift overpowers it $Ns \ll 1$).\\

\subsection{The fixation of neutral alleles}
It is very unlikely that a rare neutral allele accidentally drifts up
to fixation, it is much more likely that such an allele is eventually
is lost from the population. However, there is a large and constant influx of
rare alleles into the population due to mutation, so even if it is very
unlikely that an individual allele fixes within the population, some
neutral alleles will fix.  \\

%We'll first consider the probability that a neutral allele fixes
%within the population, starting from it just enters a diploid
%population as a newly mutated allele at frequency $1/(2N)$.

%so for an allele to be fixed in the population it
%must have been that allele


\paragraph{Probability of the eventual fixation of a neutral allele.} An allele which reaches fixation within a population, is an ancestor to
the entire population. In a particular generation there can be only single
allele that all other alleles at the locus in  later generation can claim as a
ancestor. As at a neutral locus all of our alleles are exchangeable, as
they have no effect on the number of descendents an individual
leaves, so any allele is equally likely to be the ancestor of the
entire population.  In a diploid population size of size $N$, there are $2N$
alleles all of which are equally likely to be the ancestor of the
entire population at some later time point. So if our allele is present in a single copy, the chance that
is the ancestor to the entire population in some future generation is
$1/(2N)$, i.e. the chance our neutral allele is eventually fixed is
$1/(2N)$.\\

More generally if our neutral allele is present in $i$ copies in the
population, of $2N$ alleles, the probability that this allele is fixed
is $i/(2N)$. I.e. the probability that a neutral allele is eventually
fixed is simply given by its frequency ($p$) in the population.
We can also derive this result by letting $Ns \rightarrow
0$ in eqn. \eqref{eqn:prob_fixed}.

\paragraph{Rate of substitution of neutral alleles.}

A substitution between populations that do not exchange gene flow is
simply a fixation event within one population. The rate of
substitution is therefore the rate at which new alleles fix in the
population, so that the long-term substitution rate is the rate at
which mutations arise that will eventually become fixed within our population.\\

Assume that there are two classes of mutational changes that can occur with a
region, highly deleterious mutations and neutral mutations. A fraction
$C$ of all mutational changes are highly deleterious, and can not
possibly contribute to substitution nor polymorphism (i.e. $Ns \gg 1$).
While a fraction $1-C$ are neutral. If our mutation rate is $\mu$ per
transmitted allele per generation, then a total of $2N \mu (1-C)$
neutral mutations enter our population each generation.\\

Each of these neutral mutations has a $1/(2N)$ probability chance of
eventually becoming fixed in the population. Therefore, the rate at
which neutral mutations arise that eventually become fixed within our
population is  
\begin{equation}
2N\mu(1-C)\frac{1}{2N} = \mu(1-C)
\end{equation}
thus the rate of substitution under a model where newly arising alleles are either
highly deleterious or neutral, is simply given by the mutation rate
towards neutral alleles, i.e. $\mu(1-C)$.\\

Consider a pair of species have diverged for $T$ generations, i.e. orthologous sequences shared between the species last shared a common ancestor $T$ generations ago. If they have maintained a constant $\mu$ over that time, will have accumulated an average of
\begin{equation}
2\mu(1-C)T
\end{equation}
neutral substitutions. This assumes that $T$ is a lot longer than the time it
takes to fix a neutral allele, such that the total number of 
alleles introduced into the population that will eventually fix is the
total number of substitutions. We'll see below that a neutral allele
takes on average $4N$ generations to fix from its introduction into
the population.\\

This is a really pretty result as the population size has completely
canceled out of the neutral substitution rate. However, there is
another way to see this in a more straightward way. If I look at a
sequence in me compared to say a particular chimp, I'm looking at the mutations
that have occurred in both of our germlines since they parted ways $T$
generations ago. Since neutral alleles do not alter the probability
of their transmission to the next generation, we are simply looking at
the mutations that have occurred in $2T$ generations worth of
transmissions. Thus the average number of neutral mutational
differences separating our pair of species is simply $2\mu (1-C) T$.\\




\subsection{Loss of heterozygosity due to to drift.}

Genetic drift will, in the absence of new mutations, slowly purge our
population of genetic diversity as alleles slowly drift to high or low
frequencies and are lost or fixed over time. \\

Imagine a population of a constant size $N$ diploid individuals, and
that we are examining a locus segregating for two alleles that are
neutral with respect to each other.  This population is randomly
mating with respect to the alleles at this locus.\\

In generation $t$ our current level of heterozygosity is $H_t$,
i.e. the probability that two randomly sampled alleles in generation
$t$ are non-identical is $H_t$. Assuming that the mutation rate is
zero (or vanishing small), what is our level of heterozygosity in
generation $t+1$?\\

In the next generation ($t+1$) we are looking at the alleles in the
offspring of generation $t$. If we randomly sample two alleles in generation
$t+1$ which had different parental alleles in generation $t$ then it
is just like drawing two random alleles from generation $t$. So the
probability that these two alleles in generation $t+1$, that have
different parental alleles in generation $t$, are non-identical is
$H_t$. \\

Conversely, if our pair of alleles have the same parental allele in
the proceeding generation (i.e. the alleles are identical by descent
one generation back) then these two alleles must be identical (as we
are not allowing for any mutation). \\

In a diploid population of size $N$ individuals there are $2N$
alleles. The probability that our two alleles have the same parental
allele in the proceeding generation is $1/(2N)$, the probability that
they have different parental alleles is is $1-1/(2N)$. So by the above
argument the expected heterozygosity in generation $t+1$ is
\begin{equation}
H_{t+1} = \frac{1}{2N} \times 0 + \left(1-\frac{1}{2N} \right)H_t
\end{equation}
By this argument if the heterzygosity in generation $0$ is $H_0$ our
expected heterozygosity in generation $t$ is
\begin{equation}
H_{t+1} = \left(1-\frac{1}{2N} \right)^tH_0
\end{equation}
i.e. the expected heterozygosity with our population is decaying
geometrically with each passing generation. If we assume that $1/(2N)
\ll 1$ then we can approximate this geometric decay by an exponential
decay, such that
\begin{equation}
H_{t+1} =H_0 \exp \left(-\frac{t}{2N} \right)  
\end{equation}
i.e. heterozygosity decays exponentially at a rate $1/(2N)$.

\subsection{Levels of diversity maintained by a balance between
 mutation and drift. }


\paragraph{heterozygosity}
Looking backwards in time from one generation to the next, we are going
to say that two alleles which have the same parental allele (i.e. find
their common ancestor) in the
preceding generation have {\emph coalesced}, and refer to this event as a {\emph coalescent event}.\\

The probability that our pair of randomly sampled alleles have
coalesced in the preceding generation is $1/(2N)$, the probability
that our pair of alleles fail to coalesce is $1-1/(2N)$. \\

The probability that a mutation changes the identity of the
transmitted allele is $\mu$ per generation. So the probability of no
mutation occurring is $(1-\mu)$. We'll assume that when a mutation
occurs it creates some new allelic type which is not present in the
population. This assumption (commonly called the infinitely-many-alleles model) makes the math slightly cleaner, and also
is not too bad an assumption biologically.\\

This model lets us calculate when our two alleles last shared a common
ancestor and whether these alleles are identical as a result of
failing to mutate since this shared ancestor.  For example we can work out the probability that our
two randomly sampled alleles coalesced $2$ generations in the past
(i.e. they fail to coalesce in generation $1$ and then coalescent in
generation $2$), and
that they are identical as
\begin{equation}
\left(1- \frac{1}{2N} \right) \frac{1}{2N} (1-\mu)^4
\end{equation}
note the power of $4$ is because our two alleles have to have failed
to mutate through $2$ meioses each.\\

More generally the probability that our alleles coalesce in generation
$t+1$ and are identical due to no mutation to either allele in the
subsequent generations is
\begin{equation}
P(\textrm{coal. in t+1 \& no mutations}) =  \frac{1}{2N} \left(1- \frac{1}{2N} \right)^t \left(1-\mu \right)^{2(t+1)}
\end{equation}
assuming that $\frac{1}{2N} \ll$ and $\mu \ll 1$ then we can
approximate this as
\begin{equation}
P(\textrm{coal. in t+1 \& no mutations}) \approx  \frac{1}{2N}
e^{-t/(2N)} e^{-2\mu (t+1)}
\end{equation}
to make this slightly easier on ourselves lets further assume that $t
\approx t+1$ and so rewrite this as
\begin{equation}
\approx \frac{1}{2N} e^{-t(2\mu+1/(2N))}
\end{equation}

If we sample two alleles at random from the population we will not in
general know when they share a common ancestor. In which case we will
need to integrate out over when this coalescent event occured. Doing
this we find the probability that our two alleles are identical due to
no mutation on either ancestral lineage since the pair shared a common
ancestor to be
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2N} \int_0^{\infty} e^{-t(2\mu+1/(2N))} dt =
\frac{1/(2N)}{1/(2N)+2\mu} = \frac{1}{1+4N\mu}
\end{equation}
The probability that our our pair of alleles are non-identical is
simply one minus this, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\frac{4N\mu}{1+4N\mu} \label{eqn:hetero}
\end{equation}
This compound parameter $4N\mu$, the population-scaled mutation rate,
will come up a number of times so we'll give it its own name
\begin{equation}
\theta = 4N\mu
\end{equation}

So all else being equal, species with larger population sizes should
have proportionally higher level of polymorphism at neutral sites.\\

\paragraph{Pairwise Coalescent time distribution and the number of
 pairwise differences.}
In the preceding calculation you'll note that we could first specify
what generation a pair of sequences coalesce in, and then calculate
some properties of heterozygosity based on that. That's because neutral
mutations do not affect the probability that an individual transmits
that allele, so don't affect the way in which we can trace ancestral lineages
back. \\

As such it will often be helpful to consider the time to the common
ancestor of a pair of sequences, and then think of the impact of that
on patterns of diversity. The probability that a pair of alleles
have failed to coalesce in $t$ generations and then coalesce in the
$t+1$ generation back is
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2N} (1- \frac{1}{2N} )^{t} \approx \frac{1}{2N} e^{-t/(2N)} \label{eqn:coal_time_dist}
\end{equation}
thus the coalescent time of a pair of sequences ($T_2$) is
approximately exponentially distributed with a rate $1/(2N)$. We'll denote that by
saying that $T_2 \sim Exp \left( 1/(2N) \right)$. The mean coalescent
time of a pair of a pair of alleles is $2N$ generations\\

Conditional on a pair of alleles coalescing $t$ generations ago
there are $2t$ generations in which a mutation could occur. Thus the
probability of our pair of alleles are separated by $j$ mutations
since they last shared a common ancestor is
\begin{equation}
P(j | T_2 = t ) = {2t \choose j} \mu^{j} (1-\mu)^{2t-j}
\end{equation}
i.e. mutations happen in $j$ generations, and do not happen in $2t-j$
generations (with ${2t \choose j}$ ways this can possibly
happen). Assuming that $\mu \ll 1$, and that $2t-j \approx 2t$ then we
can approximate the probability that we have $j$ mutations as a
Poisson distribution
\begin{equation}
P(j | T_2 = t ) = \frac{ (2 \mu t )^{j} e^{-2\mu t}}{j!}
\end{equation}
i.e. a Poisson with mean $2\mu t $. \\

As our expected coalescent time is $2N$ generations, the expected
number of mutations separating two alleles drawn at random from the
population is
\begin{equation}
\E(j) = 4N\mu = \theta
\end{equation}
We'll assume that mutations never happen at the same site twice,
i.e. no multiple hits, such that we get to see all of the mutation events that separate our pair
of sequences (we'll call this the infinitely-many-sites assumption,
which should be fine if $N\mu_{BP} \ll 1$). Thus the number of
mutations between a pair of sites is the observed number of
differences between a pair of sequences. \\


We'll denote the observed number of pairwise differences at putatively
neutral sites separating a
pair of sequences as $\pi$ (we usually average this over a number of
pairs of sequences for a region). So we can estimate of
$\theta$ from $\pi$, $\widehat{\theta}_{\pi}$ by setting $\widehat{\theta}_{\pi}=\pi$.
If we have an independent
estimate of $\mu$, then from setting $\pi = \widehat{\theta}_{\pi} = 4N\mu$ we can obtain an
estimate of the population size $N$ that is consistent with our levels
of neutral polymorphism.


\subsection{The effective population size.}
In practice populations rarely conform to our assumptions of being
constant in size with low variance in reproduction success. Real
populations experience dramatic fluctuations in size, and there is
often high variance in reproductive success. Thus rates of drift in
natural populations are often a lot higher than the census population
size would imply.\\

To cope with this population geneticists often invoke the concept of
an effective population size ($N_e$). In many situations (but not all), departures from model assumptions can be captured by substituting $N_e$ for $N$.

Specifically the effective population size ($N_e$) is the population
size that would result in the same rate of drift in an idealized constant
population size, obeying our modeling assumptions, as that observed in
our true population. \\

If population sizes vary rapidly in size, we can (if certain conditions are met)
replace our population size by the harmonic mean population size.
Consider a diploid population of variable size, whose size is $N_t$ $t$ generations into the
past. The probability our pairs of alleles have not coalesced by the generation $t^{th}$ is
given by
\begin{equation}
\prod_{i=1}^{t} \left(1-\frac{1}{2N_t} \right)
\end{equation}
note that this is simply collapses to our original expression
$\left(1-\frac{1}{2N } \right)^t $ if $N_i$ is constant. If $1/(N_i)$ is
small, then we can approximate $1-\frac{1}{2N_i}$ by
$\exp(-\frac{1}{2N_i})$. Such that if $N_i$ is never too small
\begin{equation}
\prod_{i=1}^{t} \left(1-\frac{1}{2N_i} \right)
\approx \prod_{i=1}^{t} \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2N_i} \right)   =
\exp \left(- \sum_{i=1}^{t} \frac{1}{2N_i} \right) .
\end{equation}
In our constant population size case
the probability of failing to coalesce is $\exp(-t/(2N))$. So the
variable population coalescent probabilities are still of the same form but
the exponent has changed. Comparing the exponent in the two cases we see
\begin{equation}
\frac{t}{2N} = \sum_{i=1}^{t} \frac{1}{2N_i}
\end{equation}
so that if we want a constant effective population size ($N_e$) that has the same
coalescent probability as our variable population we need to set
$N=N_e$ and rearrange this to see
\begin{equation}
N_e =\frac{1}{\frac{1}{t} \sum_{i=1}^{t} \frac{1}{N_i} }.
\end{equation}
this is the harmonic mean of the varying population size. Thus our
effective population size, the size of an idealized constant
population which matches the rate of genetic drift, is the harmonic
mean true population size over time. The harmonic mean is very
storngly affected by small values, such that if our population size is
one million $99\%$ of the time but drops to a $1000$ every hundred or
so generations, $N_e$ will be much closer to $1000$ than a million.\\


%would result in the same rate of drift
%Luckily, in many (not all) situations, departures from model assumptions can be captured by substituting Ne for N, i.e., by plugging in a fictitious N that leads to the same level of genetic drift as observed.

Variance in reproductive success will also affect our effective
population size. Even if our population has a large constant size of $N$
individuals, if only small proportion of them get to reproduce then
the rate of drift will reflect this much small number of reproducing
individuals. If only $N_M$ males get to contribute to the next
generation and $N_F$ females get to contribute to the next
generation. When our two alleles pick an ancestor, $25\%$ of the time
our alleles were both in a female ancestor in which case they coalesce
with probability $1/(2N_F)$, and $25\%$ of the time they are both in a
male ancestor in which case they coalesce with probability
$1/(2N_M)$. The remaining $50\%$ of the time our ancestral lineages
are in two individuals are different sexes in a generation so cannot
coalescence.  Therefore, our probability of coalescence in the preceding
generation is
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{2N_M}+\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{2N_F} =
\frac{1}{8}\frac{N_F+M_M}{N_FN_M} 
\end{equation}
i.e. the rate of coalescence is the harmonic mean of the two
sexes population sizes, 
equating this to $\frac{1}{2N_e}$ we find
\begin{equation}
N_e = \frac{4N_FN_M}{N_F+N_M}
\end{equation}
Thus if reproductive success is very skewed in one sex (e.g. $N_M \ll
N/2$) our effective population size will be much reduced as a result.\\

\subsection{The coalescent process of a sample of alleles.}

Usually we are not just interested pairs of alleles, or the
average pairwise diversity, we are interested in the properties of
diversity in samples of a number of alleles drawn from the population.  
To allow for this instead of just following a pair of lineages back until they
coalesce, we can follow the history of a sample of alleles back
through the population.

Consider first sampling three alleles at random from the
population. The probability that all three alleles choose exactly the
same ancestral allele one generation back is $1/(2N)^2$. If $N$ is
reasonably large then this is a very small probability. As such it is
very unlikely that our three alleles coalesce at once, a in a moment
we'll see that it is safe to ingnore such unlikely events. \\

The
probability that a specific pair of alleles find a common ancestor in
the preceding generation is still $1(2N)$. There are three possible
pairs of alleles so the probability that no pair finds a common
ancestor is
\begin{equation}
\left(1-\frac{1}{(2N)} \right)^3 \approx \left( 1- \frac{3}{2N} \right)
\end{equation}
in making this approximation we are multiplying out the right hand-side
and ignoring terms of $1/N^2$ and higher. \\

More generally when we sample $i$ alleles there are ${i \choose
 2}$ pairs, i.e. $i(i-1)2$ pairs, thus the probability that no pair
of alleles coalesces in the preceding generation is
\begin{equation}
\left(1-\frac{1}{(2N)} \right)^{{i \choose
 2}} \approx \left( 1- \frac{{i \choose
 2}}{2N}\right)
\end{equation}
while the probability of any pair coalescing is $\approx \frac{{i \choose
 2}}{2N}$.\\

We can ignore the possibility of more than pairs of alleles (e.g. tripletons) simultaneously
coalescing at once as terms of $1/N^2$ and higher can
be ignored as they are vanishingly rare. Obviously there are in reasonable sample sizes there are
many more triples (${i \choose 3}$), and higher order combinations, than pairs
(${i \choose 2}$) but if $i \ll N$ then we are safe to
ignore these terms.

When there are $i$ alleles the probability that we wait until the
$t+1$ generation before
any pair of alleles coalesce is
\begin{equation}
 \frac{{i \choose
 2}}{2N}\left( 1- \frac{{i \choose
 2}}{2N}\right)^{t-1} \approx  \frac{{i \choose
 2}}{2N} \exp \left( - \frac{{i \choose
 2}}{2N} t \right)
\end{equation}
thus the waiting time $T_i$ to the first coalescent event in a sample
of $i$ alleles is exponentially distributed with rate $\frac{{i \choose
 2}}{2N}$, i.e. $T_i \sim Exp\left(\frac{{i \choose
 2}}{2N} \right)$. The mean waiting time till any of pair within our
sample to coalesce is $2N/{i \choose
 2}$.\\

When a pair of alleles first find a common ancestral allele some
number of generations back further into the past we only have to keep
track of that common ancestral allele for the pair. Thus when a pair
of alleles in our sample of $i$ alleles coalesce, we then switch to
having to follow $i-1$ alleles back. Then when a pair of these $i-1$
alleles coalesce, we then have to follow $i-2$ alleles back. This
process continues until we coalesce back to a sample of two, and from
there to a single most recent common ancestor (MRCA).\\


To simulate a coalescent genealogy at a locus for a sample of $n$ alleles we therefore simply follow this
algorithm
\begin{enumerate}
\item set $i=n$.
\item We simulate a random variable to be the time $t_i$ to the next coalescent event from $t_i \sim
 Exp\left(\frac{{i \choose
 2}}{2N} \right)$
\item choose a pair of alleles to coalesce at random from all possible
 pairs.
\item set $i=i-1$
\item continue looping of steps 1-3 until $i=1$ i.e. the most recent
 common ancestor of the sample is found.
\end{enumerate}
by following this algorithm we are generating realizations of the
genealogy of our sample. \\

We will first consider the time to the most recent common ancestor of
the entire sample ($T_{MRCA}$). This is
\begin{equation}
T_{MRCA} = \sum_{i=n}^2 T_i
\end{equation}
generations back. As our coalescent times for different $i$ are independent, the expected time to the most recent common ancestor
is
\begin{equation}
\E(T_{MRCA}) = \sum_{i=n}^2 \E(T_i) = \sum_{i=n}^2  2N/{i \choose
 2}
\end{equation}
using the fact that $\frac{1}{i(i-1)}=\frac{1}{i-1} - \frac{1}{i}$ with a bit of
rearrangement we can rewrite this is
\begin{equation}
\E(T_{MRCA}) = 4N\left(1- \frac{1}{n} \right)
\end{equation}
so the average $T_{MRCA}$ scales linearly with population
size. Interestingly, as we move to larger and larger samples (i.e. $n \gg 1$) the average
time to the most recent common ancestor is converging on $4N$. What's
happening here is that in large samples our lineages typically coalesce rapidly
at the start and very soon coalesce down to a much smaller number of
lineages.   \\

Above we argued that a mutation is only becomes a fixed difference if
it is lucky enough to be the
ancestor of the entire population. As we saw above this occurs with
probability $1/(2N)$. How long does is take on average for such an
allele to fix within our population. We've just seen that it
takes $4N$ generations for a large sample of alleles to all trace
their ancestry back to a single most recent common
ancestor. Thus it must take roughly $4N$ generations for a neutral
allele present in a single copy within the the population to the
ancestor of all alleles within our population. This argument can be
made more precise, but in general we would still find that it takes
$\approx 4N$ generations for a neutral allele to go from its
introduction to fixation with the population.   \\


%%point about the fixation time of a neutral allele


The total amount of time in the genealogy ($T_{tot}$)
\begin{equation}
T_{tot} = \sum_{i=n}^2 iT_i
\end{equation}
as when there are $i$ lineages each contributes a time $T_i$ to the
total time. Taking the expectation of the total time in the genealogy
\begin{equation}
\E(T_{tot}) = \sum_{i=n}^2 i \frac{2N}{{i \choose
 2} } = \sum_{i=n}^2 \frac{4N}{i -1} =\sum_{i=n-1}^1 \frac{4N}{i}
\end{equation}
so our expected total amount of time in the genealogy scales linearly
with our population size. Our expected total amount of time is also
increasing with sample size but is doing so very slowly. To see this
more carefully we can see that for large $n$
\begin{equation}
\E(T_{tot}) = \sum_{i=n-1}^1 \frac{4N}{i} \approx 4N \int_1^n \frac{1}{i} di
= 4N \log(n-1)
\end{equation}
here we are approximating our sum by an integral, which will work for
large $n$. So our expected total amount of time in the genealogy
is growing with $n$ but it is doing so very slowly. This again follows
from the fact that in large samples the initial coalescence usually
happens very rapidly, so that extra samples adds little to the total
amount of time in the tree. \\


We saw above that the number of mutational differences between a pair
of alleles that coalescence $T_2$ generations ago was Poisson with a
mean of $2 \mu T_2$. A mutation that occurs on any branch of our
genealogy will be cause a segregating polymorphism in the sample
(making our infinitely-many-sites assumption). Thus if the total time
in the genealogy is $T_{tot}$ there is $T_{tot}$
generations for mutations. So the total number of mutations
segregating in our sample ($S$) is Poisson with mean $\mu T_{tot}$. Thus the
expected number of segregting  in history a sample of size $n$ is
\begin{equation}
\E(S) = \mu \E(T_{tot}) = \sum_{i=n-1}^1 \frac{4N\mu }{i} = \theta
\sum_{i=n-1}^1 \frac{1}{i}
\end{equation}
Thus we can use this formula to derive another estimate of the
population scaled mutation rate, by setting our observed number of
segregating sites in a sample ($S$) equal to this expectation. We'll call this estimator $\widehat{\theta}_W$
\begin{equation}
\widehat{\theta}_W =\frac{ S}{\sum_{i=n-1}^1 \frac{1}{i}}  
\end{equation}
this estimator was devised by Watterson, hence the $W$.


\subsection{Deviations from the constant population model.}
We've seen previously that changes in our population size can be
captured by an effective population size. However, this will only be a
useful measure if population sizes vary rapidly enough, that the
harmonic mean effective population size over short time periods ($\ll
N_e$) is representative of the effective population size averaged over
longer time periods. If this is not the case there is no one effective
population size, as we can not approximate our rate of drift by a
single constant population. Furthermore, we've ignored the effect of
population structure and selection which will violate our modeling
assumptions. \\

We can hope to detect violations from our constant population size
neutral model, by comparing aspects of our dataset to their expectations
and distributions under our neutral model. \\

For example we have devised two estimates of $\theta$,
$\widehat{\theta_{\pi}}$ and $\widehat{\theta_{W}}$, using
expectations of different aspects of our data (pairwise diversity and
number of segregating sites respectively). Under our constant neutral
model if we have sufficient data those two estimates should be
equal to each other on average. But if there's some violation of our model they might not
be. So one test statistic might be to take
\begin{equation}
D = \widehat{\theta_{\pi}} - \widehat{\theta_{W}}
\end{equation}
which will be zero in expectation if our data was generated by a
neutral constant population model.



\subsection{The coalescent and population structure}
Upto now we have assumed that our alleles that we have modelled in the
coalescent setting are drawn from a randomly mating population such
that any pair of lineages is equally likely to coalesce with each
other. However, when there is population structure this assumption is
violated. \\

We have previously written the measure of population structure
$F_{ST}$ as
\begin{equation}
F_{ST} = \frac{H_T-H_S}{H_T}
\end{equation}
where $H_S$ is the probability that two alleles sampled at random from a
subpopulation differ, and $H_T$ is the probability that two alleles sampled at random from a
subpopulation differ. We can relate these to our pairwise coalescent
process, as $H_S$ is simply the probability that two alleles sampled
from our subpopulation mutate before they coalesce. If our pair of
alleles drawn from our sub-population coalesce at time $T_S$ then the
probability that they are different is
\begin{equation}
1-e^{-2 \mu T_S} \approx 2 \mu T_S
\end{equation}
where this last approximation assumes that $\mu T_S \ll 1$. Thus
averaging over the coalescent time of our pair of alleles
\begin{equation}
H_S \approx 2\mu \E(T_S)
\end{equation}
and similarly $H_T \approx 2 \mu \E(T_T)$. So we can write
\begin{equation}
F_{ST}  \approx \frac{\E(T_T) - \E(T_S)}{\E(T_T)}
\end{equation}
so $F_{ST}$ is an expression of the decrease in pairwise coalescent
times with a subpopulation compared to the total population. This also
gives us a way to work out analytical expression for $F_{ST}$ under
simple models of population structure.\\


\paragraph{A simple population split model}
Imagine a population of constant size of $N$ diploid individuals that
$\tau$ generations in the past split into two daughter populations
each of size $N_e$ individuals, who do not subsequently exchange
migrants. The in the current day we sample an equal number of alleles
from both subpopulations.

The expected coalescent time of a pair of lineages sampled from the same
subpopulation is simple $\E(T_S) = 2N_e$. The expected coalescent time
when our alleles are sampled from different subpopulations is $\tau +
2N_e$, as our pair of lineages can not coalesce untill $\tau$
generations in the past. When we sample two alleles from our total
population, $50\%$ of the time they are drawn from the same
subpopulation and $50\%$ of the time they are drawn from different
subpopulations so
\begin{equation}
\E(T_T) = \tfrac{1}{2} (\tau +
2N_e) + \tfrac{1}{2}2N_e = \frac{\tau}{2} +2N_e
\end{equation}

so that under this simple population split model
\begin{equation}
F_{ST}  \approx \frac{\tau/2}{\tau/2 + 2N_e} =\frac{\tau/(4N_e)}{\tau/(4N_e) +1}
\end{equation}
i.e. $F_{ST}$ at first linearly increases with the divergence time
rescaled by the population size, such that the same divergence time
causes less differentiation in larger populations. \\

Assuming that $\approx \frac{\tau}{2N_e} \ll 1$ then
\begin{equation}
F_{ST}  \approx \frac{\tau}{4N_e}
\end{equation}


\paragraph{A simple model of migration between an island and the mainland}
We can also use the coalescent to think about patterns of
differentiation under a simple model of migration drift
equilibrium. Lets consider a small island population that is isolated
from a large mainland population, and that both of these populations
are constant in size. Our island has a population size
$N_{I}$ that is very small compared to our mainland population.

Each generation some low fraction $m$ of our individuals on the
island have migrant parents from the mainland the generation
before. Our island may also send migrants back to the mainland, but
these are a drop in the ocean compared to the large population size on
the mainland and their effect can be ignored. The expected coalescent
time for a pair of alleles sampled on the mainland is $\E(T_{M})$

If we sample an allele on the island back and trace its ancestral
lineage backward in time, each generation our ancestral allele have a low
probability $m$ of being descended from the mainland in the proceeding
generation. So the probability that a pair of alleles sampled on the
island are descended from a recent common ancestral allele on the island, is simply the
probability that our pair of alleles coalesce before either lineage
migrates. The probability that neither lineage migrates to the mainland
in the preceding generation is $(1-m)^2 \approx e^{-2m}$, so the
probability that neither of migrates to the mainland moving backwards
in time, before the pair coalesce is
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{\infty} e^{-2mt} \frac{1}{2N_{I}} e^{t/(2N_{I})} =
\frac{1/(2N_{I})}{1/(2N_{I})+2m} = \frac{1}{4N_{I}m+1} \label{eqn:coal_before_mig}
\end{equation}
note the similarity of this argument to that by which we derived the
expected heterozygosity (see work leading to eqn. \eqref{eqn:hetero}).

For a pair of alleles sampled on the island the time to either a coalescent event on
the island or a migration event off the island is an exponential random variable
$\sim Exp(1/(2N_{I})+2m)$, so our expected time back to our first
event is
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{1/(2N_{I})+2m} =\frac{2N_{I}}{1+4N_{I}m}
\end{equation}
If this is a coalescent event, which it is with probability
eqn. \eqref{eqn:coal_before_mig}, then we are done. If this first event is a
migration event of one of our lineages in the island (which it is with probability
1- eqn. \eqref{eqn:coal_before_mig}) we then have to
wait on average $1/m$ generations to the other allele migrates to the
mainland. Once both of our alleles are on the mainland they take a
further $\E(T_M)$ generations on average until the coalesce.  The expected coalescent time of a pair of alleles sampled on the
island is
\begin{equation}
\E(T_{I}) = \frac{2N_{I}}{1+4N_{I}m} + \frac{1}{1+4N_{I}m}
\times 0 + \frac{4N_{I}m}{1+4N_{I}m} \left( \frac{1}{m} + \E(T_{M})\right)
\end{equation}
This is a somewhat ugly
expression, but if we assume that that the times $2N_I$
and $1/m$ are small compared to $\E(T_M)$ then
\begin{equation}
\E(T_{I}) \approx \frac{4N_{I}m}{1+4N_{I}m} \E(T_{M})
\end{equation}
this assumption is equivalent to assuming that the vast proportion of polymorphism on
the island is due to the migration of different alleles from the mainland.\\

We'll assume that we have sampled alleles from the mainland and
island roughly in proportion to their population sizes such that
$\E(T_T) \approx \E(T_M)$, i.e. our heterozygosity in our total
population is dominant, such that
\begin{equation}
F_{ST} \approx \frac{\E(T_M)-\E(T_I)}{\E(T_M)}
\end{equation}
We can then substitute our expressions for
$\E(T_T)$ and $\E(T_S)=\E(T_I)$ into $F_{ST}$. Doing so we arrive at
\begin{equation}
F_{ST} \approx \frac{1}{1+4N_Im}
\end{equation}

\section{The effect of linked selection on patterns of neutral diversity}

A newly derived allele with an additive selection coefficient $s$ will
take a time $\tau= \approx 2\log(2N)/s$ generations to reach to fixation
within our population. This short time window offers very little time
for recombination between the the selected site and linked neutral
sites.  \\

First lets imagine examining variation at a locus fully linked
to our selected locus, just after our sweep reached fixation. A pair of neutral alleles sampled at this locus
must both trace their ancestral lineages back through to the neutral
allele on whose background the selected allele initially arose. As
that neutral allele, which existed $\tau$ generations ago is the
ancestor of the entire population at this locus. Our individuals who
carry the beneficial allele are, from the perspective of these two
alleles, exactly like a rapidly expanding population. Therefore, our
pair of neutral alleles sampled at our locus will be forced to
coalesce $\approx \tau$ generations ago. This is a very
short-time scale compared to the average neutral coalescent tie of
$2N$ generations of a pair of alleles.\\

If we now allow recombination into our model we can think about a pair
of alleles sampled at a neutral locus a recombination distance $r$
away from our selected site. Our pair of alleles will be forced to
coalesce $\approx \tau$ generations if neither of them reside on
haplotypes that the selected allele recombined onto during the
sweep. This is equivalent to saying that neither of our neutral
alleles recombine off of the beneficial allele's background moving
backward in time.\\

The probability that our lineage fail recombines off our beneficial
allele's background and onto the
ancestral background in the $j^{th}$ generation back is
\begin{equation}
r (1-X(j))
\end{equation}
so the probability ($p_{NR}$) that our lineage fails to recombine off in the
$\tau$ generations it takes our selected allele to move through the
population is
\begin{equation}
p_{NR}=\prod_{j=1}^{\tau} \big(1- r(1-X(j))\big)
\end{equation}
assuming that $r$ is small then $ \left(1- r(1-X(j))\right) \approx
e^{-r(1-X(j))}$, such that
\begin{equation}
p_{NR}=\prod_{j=1}^{\tau} \left(1- r(1-X(j))\right) \approx \exp
\left( -r\sum_{j=1}^{\tau}
1- X(j) \right) =\exp
\left( -r \tau 1-\widehat{X} \right)
\end{equation}
where
$\widehat{X}$ is the average frequency of the derived allele across the trajectory
$\widehat{X} = \frac{1}{\tau}  \sum_{j=1}^{\tau}
 X(j)$. As our allele is additive its trajectory for frequencies
 $<0.5$ is the mirror image of its trajectory for frequency $>0.5$, therefore it
average frequency $\widehat{X} =0.5$. So
\begin{equation}
p_{NR} = e^{-r \tau/2 }.
\end{equation}
The probability that both of our lineages fail to recombine off the
sweep and hence are forced to coalesce is $p_{NR}^2$, assuming that
they coalesce at a time close to $\tau$ so that they recombine
independently of each other for times $< \tau$.\\

If one or other of our lineages recombine off the sweep it will take them on average
$\approx 2N$ generations to find a common ancestor as we are back our
neutral coalescent. Thus the expected time
till our pair of lineages find a common ancestor is
\begin{equation}
\E(T_2)  = \tau \times p_{NR}^2 +(1-p_{NR}^2) (\tau +2N) \approx
\left(1-p_{NR}^2 \right) 2N
\end{equation}
where this last approximation assumes that $\tau \ll 2N$. So the
expected pairwise diversity for neutral alleles at a recombination
distance $r$ away from the selected sweep  ($\pi_r$) is
\begin{equation}
\E(\pi_r) = 2\mu \E(T_2)  \approx \theta \left(1-e^{-r\tau} \right) \label{eqn:pi_HH}
\end{equation}
so diversity increases as we move away from the selected site,
slowly exponentially plauteuing to its neutral expectation $\theta=4N\mu$.\\

To get a sense of the physical scale over which diversity is reduced
consider a region where recombination occurs at a rate $r_{BP}$ per
base pair per generation, and our locus is $ \ell $ base pairs away from the
selected site $r=r_{BP } \ell $ (where $r_{BP}  \ell  \ll 1$ so we don't need to
worry about more than one recombination event occurring per
generation). Typical
recombination rates are on the order of $r_{BP} = 10^{-8}$, in Figure
\ref{fig:hitchhiking_reduction} we show the reduction in diversity,
given by eqn. \eqref{eqn:pi_HH}, for two different selection coefficients.\\ 

For our expected diversity levels to recover to $50\%$ of
its neutral expectation $\E(\pi_r)/\theta=0.5$, requires a physical
distance $\ell^{*}$ such that $\log(0.5) = -r_{BP} \ell ^*\tau$ as using our
expression for $\tau$ then $ \ell^* = \frac{s}{r_{BP} \log(4N)}$. The width of our trough of reduced diversity depends on $s/r_{BP}$,
so  else being equal we expect stronger sweeps or sweeps in regions of low
recombination to have a larger hitchhiking effect. So that a selection coefficient of $s=0.1\%$ would reduce
diversity over 10's of kb, while a sweep of $s=1\%$ would affect
$\sim$100kb.   \\

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figs/hitchhiking_reduction.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Reduction in diversity compared to its neutral expectation as
a function of the distance away from a site where a selected allele
has just gone to fixation. The recombination rate is $r_{BP}= 1\times
10^{-8}$.} \label{fig:hitchhiking_reduction}
\end{figure}

\subsection{A simple recurrent model of selective sweeps}
We sample a pair of neutral alleles at a locus a genetic distance $r$ away from a locus where
sweeps are initiated within the population at some very low rate $\nu$
per generation. The waiting time between sweeps
at our locus is exponential $\sim Exp(\nu)$. Each sweep rapidly transits through the population in $\tau$
generations, such that each sweep is finished long before the next
sweep ($\tau \ll 1/\nu$). \\

As before our chance that our neutral lineage fails to recombine
off the sweep is $p_{NR}$, such that the probability that
our pair of lineages are forced to coalesce by a sweep $e^{-r \tau}$. Our
lineages therefore have a very low probability
\begin{equation}
\nu e^{-r \tau}
\end{equation}
of being forced to coalesce by a sweep per generation. In addition of
lineages can coalesce at a neutral rate of $1/(2N)$. Thus the average
waiting time till a coalescent event between our neutral pair of
lineages due to either a sweep or a neutral coalescent event is
\begin{equation}
\E(T_2) = \frac{1}{\nu e^{-r \tau} + 1/(2N)}
\end{equation}

Now imagine that the sweeps don't occur at a fixed location with
respect to our locus of interest, but now occur uniformly at random
across our sequence. The sweeps are initiated at a very low rate of
$\nu_{BP}$ per basepair per generation. The rate of coalescent due to
sweeps at a locus $\ell$ basepairs away from our neutral loci is
$\nu_{BP} e^{-r_{BP} \ell \tau}$. If our neutral locus is in the
middle of a chromosome that stretches $L$ basepairs in either direction
the total rate of sweeps per generation that force our pair of lineages to coalesce is
\begin{equation}
2\int_0^{L} \nu_{BP} e^{-r_{BP} \ell \tau} d \ell =
\frac{\nu_{BP}}{r_{BP} \tau} \left(1-e^{-r_{BP} \tau L} \right)
\end{equation}
so that if $L$ is very large ($r_{BP} \tau L \gg 1$) the rate of coalesce per
generation due to sweeps is $\frac{2\nu_{BP}}{r_{BP} \tau}$. The total rate
of coalescence for a pair of lineages per generation is then
\begin{equation}
\frac{2\nu_{BP}}{r_{BP} \tau}+\frac{1}{2N}
\end{equation}
So our average time till a pair of lineages coalesce is
\begin{equation}
\E(T_2) = \frac{1}{\frac{2\nu_{BP}}{r_{BP} \tau}+\frac{1}{2N}} = \frac{r_{BP}2N}{\frac{4N\nu_{BP}}{ \tau}+r_{BP}}
\end{equation}
such that our expected pairwise diversity ($\pi=2\mu\E(T_2)$) in a region of
recombination rate $r_{BP}$ that experiences sweeps at rate $\nu_{BP}$
is  
\begin{equation}
\E(\pi) = \theta \frac{r_{BP}}{\frac{4N\nu_{BP}}{ \tau}+r_{BP}} \label{eqn:pi_GW_HH}
\end{equation}
